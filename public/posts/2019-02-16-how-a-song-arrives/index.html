I’ve been writing songs since I was 7. A family friend had given birth to a baby boy, and for whatever reason, I decided to write a song about it on piano. I don’t remember the process, though I do remember playing the song at recitals. My piano teacher even let me make sheet music for the song using Midi.
Then, when I was 13, I wrote a poem that an older friend turned into a song. What a special thing to do, collaborating on music and lyrics. Again, I don’t remember the process. This was also the year I bought a guitar. And though I didn’t know how to tune it or play it, just its presence made me feel at ease. Like how some people feel about sleeping with a gun under their pillow except slightly less intense.

<p>I’ve been writing songs since I was 7. A family friend had given birth to a baby boy, and for whatever reason, I decided to write a song about it on piano. I don’t remember the process, though I do remember playing the song at recitals. My piano teacher even let me make sheet music for the song using Midi.</p>
<p>Then, when I was 13, I wrote a poem that an older friend turned into a song. What a special thing to do, collaborating on music and lyrics. Again, I don’t remember the process. This was also the year I bought a guitar. And though I didn’t know how to tune it or play it, just its presence made me feel at ease. Like how some people feel about sleeping with a gun under their pillow except slightly less intense.</p>
<p>At 14, I bought a new and better guitar and used the internet to learn some of my favorite songs. There was a song rattling around in my head, and so I created chords for it on guitar in about 20 mins. I don’t remember how it happened. I remember when it was done.</p>
<p>And since then I’ve had many guitars and I’ve written hundreds of songs. And I often describe the writing process as reception: I <em>receive</em> a song from some kind of higher power. It comes gift wrapped.</p>
<p>Noodling on the guitar brings about some interesting chord changes, and sometimes I’ll play a cool chord progression for a while until a song descends to claim the progression. It’s as if I have nothing to do with it at all.</p>
<p>But I’ve tried lately to catch myself, to observe what’s happening in my brain when these songs arrive. There’s one right now, on the tip of my tongue burning a hole in the roof of my mouth, trying to inject itself directly into my brain.</p>
<p>I can just make out the melody there, in the distance. I hear cadences, rhythms, even words, and a general spirit of the song, but I couldn’t play it for you. It’s a fetus. All I’ve got are ultrasounds but those only show me the shape of the thing.</p>
<p>At some point the song will be visible to me, the shadowy edges will become sharp, and the point of the song will smack my across the face. I already know the song by heart, but now I have to translate it into wave forms.</p>
<p>And this is how a song arrives.</p>
<p>I can’t go to meet it.</p>
<p>It has to make its way to me, like a weary traveler looking for a home.</p>
