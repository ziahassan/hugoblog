  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>For my eighth birthday, I opted to have a smaller birthday party, which meant about 3 people. I specifically remember what each person at my party game me for my birthday.</p>
<p>One boy had given me a video game, one that I played for years and years, called Dr. Robotnik’s Mean Bean Machine. Another child had given me my first box of Hot Tamales, and I was addicted from then on. The third gift I got was a book called Magic Eye.</p>
<p>In the book were a series of boring looking paintings made of bizarre patterns.</p>
<p>“There’s a trick to it,” my friend told me. “If you stare at the pictures long enough, you’ll start to see hidden 3-D images.”</p>
<p>So, I saw in my living room and tried to see the 3D images. At times, I thought maybe I had seen something, but usually the image was fleeting. I tried everything to make it happen – I brought the book close to my face at the suggestion of my friend, and also pulled it far away.</p>
<p>I watched my friend do it, make the 3D images appear… but it didn’t help, because it was happening in <em>his</em> vision, not mine. It was hard for him to explain how to do magic eye… he said, it’s just something you <em>get</em>.</p>
<p>I stared and scrunched and scrutinized and analyzed… but I couldn’t get it. No matter what strategy I used, I always ended up feeling eye-strained and hopeless.</p>
<p>Until one afternoon, when I had almost given up hope. I reluctantly pulled the book out one more time and looked at the images. I figured that this would have to be my last attempt before I just put the book away forever. At this point, I didn’t even care whether or not I’d see the hidden 3D images.</p>
<p>I looked at one of the images, of fish in an aquarium, but this time I did it casually. Like I didn’t care.</p>
<p>And at that very moment, dozens of fish came off the page, floating in front of the book. A hidden 3D image. I finally <em>got it</em>.</p>
<p>Getting a Magic Eye is a weird skill that is hard to describe to someone who has never experienced it. It’s a very distinct relaxing of the eye that we normally don’t perform, at least consciously. It reminds me about all of the other concepts and ways of seeing that seem <em>so obvious</em> to one person, and so out of reach for another.</p>
<p>Also, Magic Eye reminds me that with some puzzles, the harder we try to break through, the less successful we end up being. Like a Chinese Finger Trap, or a box puzzle, the solution is often much simpler than we think.</p>
<p>In this case, I learned about the duality of desire: the moment I didn’t care about winning anymore, I won.</p>
