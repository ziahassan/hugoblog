I wanted those headphones that they had in store, the Koss Td-80&rsquo;s. The sound is phenomenal on those baby&rsquo;s. I went out and bought them and they sucked. So uncomfortable. So I traded them in for the newer model. I wear them now but I just put on my old sony&rsquo;s. What a warm sound. Sure it&rsquo;s a little muddy sometimes… but it&rsquo;s so comfortable. You really forget that they are on your head. I need create a headphone one day that does what the TD-80 does, with the comfort of the Sony&rsquo;s. You think that the Koss people would take that into account when they are making their phones! But no.

<p>I wanted those headphones that they had in store, the Koss Td-80&rsquo;s. The sound is phenomenal on those baby&rsquo;s. I went out and bought them and they sucked. So uncomfortable. So I traded them in for the newer model. I wear them now but I just put on my old sony&rsquo;s. What a warm sound. Sure it&rsquo;s a little muddy sometimes… but it&rsquo;s so comfortable. You really forget that they are on your head. I need create a headphone one day that does what the TD-80 does, with the comfort of the Sony&rsquo;s. You think that the Koss people would take that into account when they are making their phones! But no.</p>
<p>Anyway. Today was a typical Monday. I woke in an OK mood cuz I had done most of my homework. My sister had a science project to attend to, so I ended up just driving myself and Christine to school. It was nice for her to be in the front for a change.</p>
<p>Once again in math I didn&rsquo;t have my HW but I don&rsquo;t think she marked off for it. I made some cute little remark about how I didn&rsquo;t really know what I was doing and just wrote something, and she just laughed. It&rsquo;s gonna be nice not to have that class next semester. I just need to do well on the freaking exam. As long as I get good semester grades, I&rsquo;m pretty much set for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>Nothing special happened in school today. I read my Football story for my creative writing class and they seemed to dig it… I felt good. First time in that class where I think I read something that I was proud of.</p>
<p>Then I came home directly after school, for some reason feeling like total shit. Slept for 3 hours. Woke up and Christine was online… suddenly remembered where I was and felt a lot better. Talked to Grant too. I swear that Grant&rsquo;s some sorta gift or something, he&rsquo;s the perfect friend. The guy who always sticks up for you even when he knows you&rsquo;re wrong. And he&rsquo;s one of the very few people I know that like Toad. But then again, I introduced him to Toad in Egypt. I guess that&rsquo;s why we like music we heard in Egypt so much. All of my favorite records were bought while I was in Egypt… or at least over that period of time. Duncan Sheik, Dog&rsquo;s Eye View, 3 Toad records. All my favorites.</p>
<p>Read some more about time travel! Still can&rsquo;t figure out if scientists generally think it&rsquo;s possible or not. Some say physics won&rsquo;t allow it, some say it will. I went down to the bookshelf down stairs and took out a few books that I think could help me figure out more about time travel. Some Madeleine L&rsquo;Engle… just because she is a KILLER storyteller. And she has a concept of what time travel is and how it works. And I like the way she describes it. Some of those preteen books are REALLY gripping, and I&rsquo;m not even kidding. I found HG Wells&rsquo; The Time Machine. See what his take is on it. Then some book called I Ching… apparently has some wisdom. I&rsquo;m willing to try it. An Asimov book of short stories, I figured it might be interesting. A book of Shakespeare&rsquo;s early comedies, just cuz the guy rules. He really does. And the tibetan book of the dead, my dad&rsquo;s recommendation.</p>
<p>Joe Millionaire was on tonight. Heidi was eliminated! Go Joe! I dig this guy. Still think he shoulda kept Dana though.</p>
<p>My parents are leaning more and more towards me staying at home next year. And I don&rsquo;t want to, but I&rsquo;m starting to think that I really have no choice unless things change financially. It&rsquo;s my choice – I picked an expensive school. Granted it&rsquo;s the only one of the few that has my major………… but I still wish there was a cheaper school. I shoulda applied to the regular program….</p>
<p>Toad rules. Two more months! What&rsquo;s on a agenda for tommorow. Maybe a little trip to the library, maybe see Utkarsh if he&rsquo;s home. Homework has become a thing of the past to me.</p>
<p>Love: like an infant trying to stand up.</p>
