  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>I&rsquo;ve had to put together about 3 binders today.  The rest of the day I&rsquo;ve sat around listening to music and reading about synthesizers.  I did find a cool website called longnow.org which has lectures about forward thinking.  Stewart Brand created this orgnization who found it interesting that different people of different cultures envisioned the concept of &ldquo;now&rdquo; very differently.  </p>
<p>If you asked someone what they were working on &ldquo;now,&rdquo; would they refer to what they&rsquo;ve been doing that hour?  That morning?  That year?  The Long Now organization has decided to make &ldquo;now&rdquo; encompass the next 10,000 years.  They&rsquo;ve even made a clock that plays bells.  They have all of their lectures on the site, and I was listening to the kick-off speech from Eno.  He began by talking about his first ambient record (discreet music, which I still haven&rsquo;t heard), and then went onto the other ambient ones and explained why they relate to time and &ldquo;now.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>Last night, Mariam and Billy came over to watch Prison Break.  I love re-watching that show unfold.  PJ called and said he was home, so him and Andy joined later.  I should&rsquo;ve napped but I spent the entire afternoon playing with my new gear.  Made a quick demo of 2 birds, just to see how it sounded when I was fully listening, and also did a verse and chorus of Bows and Arrows in Garage Band.  That one actually came out sounding nice.</p>
<p>Then I saw an amazing video of an Indian guy who created a synth out of  a really cool usb device with a bunch of colored balls.  He throws the balls around and where they hit the wall is where they change velocity and shape.  I want to learn to make music with forces that I can&rsquo;t control, like throwing a ball: it lands in a different place everytime, you did the initial work, and physics took care of the rest.  Drawing on a higher power.</p>
<p>After Prison Break, we went to Andy&rsquo;s to watch the storm.  Big streaks of lightning, so big that they lit up the entire sky.  We couldn&rsquo;t do the lightning-thunder calculation because there was too much lightning, we couldn&rsquo;t figure out what corresponded to what.  We sat on his deck, sheilded by the short ceiling, smoking fruit, and watching the lightning.  I&rsquo;m glad PJ picked last night to be home.</p>
<p>Idea:  Compose a series of short stories, that will eventually become songs.  Then, write a series of songs that will eventually become short stories.  We&rsquo;ll call this skill development.</p>
<p>Andy caught me off guard the other night with the question: What is it about music that you feel emotionally connected to?  I gave him the answer that I&rsquo;ve always believed, that music is a higher being.   He went to ask me if that meant that music was a better form of communication than words.  Too much one-dimensional thinking, and too much black-or-white.  (From Contact) I&rsquo;ll never be able to articulate it, but every inch of me knows that it exists.  People don&rsquo;t use the idea of God as a communication tool, they draw energy, love, whatever from that higher being which is available to them all the time, day or night.  </p>
<p>Last night, Andy said that to him, lightning is proof that there is a God.  To me, it&rsquo;s all spread over different channels.  Lightning, music, particles.  Wherever it appears that is relative to you.</p>
<p>Plans for tonight:  Go to the library and pay for my overdue library books, check out new ones that I inevitably won&rsquo;t read.  But it&rsquo;s nice to know that they&rsquo;re there.  I&rsquo;ll see if I can find anything on Dark Matter.  Sleep, maybe try recording.  Head over to Scott&rsquo;s to work out arrangements and sing a little.  Hopefully he&rsquo;s written a song. </p>
<p>Tommorow is the weekend.  This has been a long week. </p>
