        <p>Seeing Austin Kleon tonight at Politics and Prose was highly enjoyable. He has such interesting thoughts and I love his books. Not to mention, his blackout poetry is really creative.</p>
<p>One of the things he said that really stuck with me was the idea of making gifts. That we we will sometimes see a friend’s good art and then say that they should make an Etsy store or, in my case, try out for American Idol.</p>
<p>But in the ancient days, art was made for communication and beautification. The whole idea of folk music, I suppose, was a communal and shared experience. It’s why acoustic guitars exist: you don’t need amplifiers or electricity. We’ve made pickups for acoustics of course, but the acoustic guitar as a concept is made for small rooms and porches.</p>
<p>Like the father who draws his child a cartoon and puts it in his lunch bag every day, we should nourish those around us with our art. I suppose that’s what I try to do here, with a daily blog. I end up writing so many pieces that are so varied in scope. Each one is for a different person in my life though I don’t ever tell them. Perhaps I should.</p>
<p>Because ultimately this is what the distinction is between good art and bad art: good art was made for someone specifically. Bad art is made for everyone, and therefore no one.</p>
