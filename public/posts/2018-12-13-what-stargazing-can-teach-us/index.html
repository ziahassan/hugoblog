Last year, I started advertising my services as a professional magician around the holidays. The idea was that I’d perform at holiday parties to small groups of adults while they talked, ate, and drank.
So I booked my first gig and found out there was a miscommunication (or perhaps a non-communication) and instead of walking around doing tricks for adults, I was going to be at a table performing tricks for children. This wasn’t the worst news; I had spent years as an elementary school teacher, so I was used to working with and performing for kids.

<p>Last year, I started advertising my services as a professional magician around the holidays. The idea was that I’d perform at holiday parties to small groups of adults while they talked, ate, and drank.</p>
<p>So I booked my first gig and found out there was a miscommunication (or perhaps a non-communication) and instead of walking around doing tricks for adults, I was going to be at a table performing tricks for children. This wasn’t the worst news; I had spent years as an elementary school teacher, so I was used to working with and performing for kids.</p>
<p>Still, it made me think, as many situations tend to do. It was assumed that as a magician, I’d be performing for kids. In fact, whenever I perform for the children of friends, the adults tend to tune out.</p>
<p>A magic trick, in their mind, is the equivalent of a balloon animal. Delightful for the young, but useless for the old.</p>
<p>I’ve written about <a href="https://www.ziahassan.com/daily/magic-is-a-gift/">magic</a> before. I see it as a gift, an opportunity to escape the chains of the “real world” for a moment. To experience something surreal.</p>
<p>Most adults don’t see it this way.</p>
<p>Unlike the balloon animal though, a magic trick gives an adult access to the child within them. We live in a world of daily routine, of 9-5, of soccer practice, of yearly traditions, of family dinners, of Netflix sitcoms, and of political theater.</p>
<p>And honestly, maybe the same goes for the balloon animal. Maybe the same goes for Saturday morning cartoons, and fruit loops, and summer camps.</p>
<p>Maybe the same goes for long road trips where you fall asleep listening to the same 12 songs on your discman.</p>
<p>Same goes for coloring books.</p>
<p>Adult coloring books were a popular holiday gift a few years ago. Up until then, we hadn’t thought of “coloring” as an adult activity – but some marketers came along and changed our perception. It wasn’t as if the activity itself was inherently childish, no, it was that the activity was <em>associated</em> with children.</p>
<p>If you don’t love the feeling of not knowing how something works, magic can sometimes be unsatisfying. And this is how many adults operate.</p>
<p>Except that we <em>don’t</em> know how everything works, we just convince ourselves we do. The only difference is that with magic, the mystery is intentional. It’s administered by a professional wonder-smith.</p>
<p>When you look at a stars, are you picturing unromantic giant balls of gas? Do you know the intricate details of the math and science that brought you this incredible view for stargazing? Do you <em>need</em> to?</p>
<p>Or are you simply in awe of its beauty?</p>
<p>Like the song asks, “what’s so amazing that keeps us stargazing?”</p>
<p>After all, to gaze is to be in awe.</p>
<p>Kids, on the other hand, don’t <em>need</em> to know how everything works. They don’t care. What’s important to them is how an experience makes them feel.</p>
<p>And while we can’t operate in that mode all the time, there’s room for it in our lives if we allow it.</p>
