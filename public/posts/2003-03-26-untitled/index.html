A semi eventful day in the life of me.
The day at school was short. I think this is mainly due to the fact that Billy, Jon, PJ, and I left school around 4th period to go to McDonalds. A day well spent, because in the words of Billy‚Ä¶ McDonald&rsquo;s is the shit. We saw all the QO kids there on their open lunch break. Glad we had Billy with us, otherwise there&rsquo;da been trouble brewin. Not really. But still, it&rsquo;s nice to feel safe. Ah, being a senior. Nothin better.

<p>A semi eventful day in the life of me.</p>
<p>The day at school was short. I think this is mainly due to the fact that Billy, Jon, PJ, and I left school around 4th period to go to McDonalds. A day well spent, because in the words of Billy‚Ä¶ McDonald&rsquo;s is the shit. We saw all the QO kids there on their open lunch break. Glad we had Billy with us, otherwise there&rsquo;da been trouble brewin. Not really. But still, it&rsquo;s nice to feel safe. Ah, being a senior. Nothin better.</p>
<p>After days and days of long rehearsals, it was nice to finally come home at 2. I was gonna go for a walk with Christine originally, but then it rained and she had work to do‚Ä¶ and it was probably for the better, because I got some time to chill in my room and play soft music and strum my guitar.</p>
<p>Yuck. Just coughed and it burned. I&rsquo;m really congested. This needs to end. I mean, we have a show tommorow night, and then I have to sing in front of the whole school on Tuesday. I&rsquo;ll just take some sudafed and hope for the best.</p>
<p>Where was I? Yeah, so I came home and was chillin out at my computer and then Mariam called me. Turns out she was on the beltway and the traffic was horrible, so she needed a place to chill so I had her over till dinner time. I guess she went to Jess&rsquo; then but it was a nice afternoon. We didn&rsquo;t do anything ‚Äì just kinda sat around and talked, watched a little bit of the news and groaned at the TV.</p>
<p>I have to register for the Selective Service since I&rsquo;m 18. I hate the fact that I am forced to sign up for this shit, and if I don&rsquo;t I could be in jail for 5 years. I mean really, how much sense does that make? There are some who would argue‚Ä¶ but my point is still valid. I also just emailed American back about this overnight thing they&rsquo;re doing. I figure I should probably go and see what my Universtiy is like when you&rsquo;re living there. Plus, I might meet someone I want to room with, it&rsquo;s probably a good idea.</p>
<p>Then I found out I had to write an essay‚Ä¶ and Schlaf helped me write it. Funny thing about him, is he knows exactly what he&rsquo;s talking about, yet he never does the work himself! No shame in it though ‚Ä¶ as if I&rsquo;ve turned in anything on time in the past 2 months. I think Ms. Jones was pleased that I actually had something in on time. Funny person that Ms. Jones. Movin to Cali right on the day of our AP exam. Well, good for her I say. Enjoy the sunshine Ms. J.</p>
<p>And of course, there is a show tommorow night. I plan on playing Skip Bo with David until the very minute we have to go on. Cuz that game rules and I need to go crazy before the show. And what better to go crazy than with Skip Bo? I could truly be a salesman.</p>
<p>On a crappy-ass note, Saturday night they&rsquo;re predicting T-Storms‚Ä¶ meaning we might have an indoor apache. That is fucking ridiciolous on closing night of the show. If it were just a matter of costumes we could just take them off. But I guess getting everyone to take off their mic is gonna be a pain in the ass. So‚Ä¶ indoor apache it is üôÅ</p>
<p>Gone through an entire packet of gum on this entry. Ugh! I am a sick bastar</p>
