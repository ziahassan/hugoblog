        <p>Another day, another lesson learned from tech support.</p>
<p>This time, it’s the scenario that has played out so many times over both of my careers in tech: someone complains about a bug, or something that doesn’t work properly. I ask them to replicate it so I can see it happen. The person tries to replicate the issue, and this time, there’s no problem.</p>
<p>And they always say this line: “it’s because you’re standing here!”</p>
<p>It’s a joke, of course. They don’t actually believe my presence made the issue work. But we examine the difference between the time it worked and the time it didn’t… and the difference is I was standing here.</p>
<p>Yes. I was standing here watching. And you know that you were being watched. And so you took yourself out of autopilot for a moment and paid attention to where your hands where, which options were ticked, which buttons were pressed. And whatever your autopilot brain made you do before that caused a malfunction, you avoided this time. And so it worked.</p>
<p>If there’s a lesson here, it’s probably that <em>paying attention</em> is a tool that you can use when things don’t work.</p>
<p>Your kids won’t clean up their room like you asked? <em>Pay attention</em> to the procedure. What steps happened to create this “malfunction?” You think you’re being strict, but you didn’t provide enough steps to make tidying a solid process and an autonomous habit. You knew this was important, but yelling at the kids was easier (and perhaps an autonomous habit for you).</p>
<p>You can’t lose weight even though you’re dieting and working out? <em>Pay attention</em> to the procedure. You think you’re eating healthy, but you didn’t count the sugar in your morning latte that added 250 calories. You ate a cookie after your run that was about 300 calories, when the run only burned 240 calories. You knew eating less was important, but you didn’t track every calorie meticulously. (Hint: food journaling and calorie counting are versions of paying attention).</p>
<p>Accountability, that matters too. My watchful eye holds my tech user accountable in a non-accusatory way. Who’s watching what you’re watching? Who is paying attention to the things you’re not?</p>
<p>It’s easy to rely on our autopilot brains and then get frustrated when things don’t work out. What’s hard is paying attention.</p>
<p>And the investment you make by paying attention? It pays off when your brain gets rewired and these changes become part of the habit.</p>
<p>A worthy investment, if you ask me.</p>
