  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>One of the many ways in which our world will change as a result of generative AI will be the way in which students engage with school.</p>
<p>Even in the last few years, things have changed regarding engagement.</p>
<p>The pandemic brought about extremely lax policies with phones, for example. I&rsquo;ve seen it in middle/high school classrooms when I coach teachers, and it&rsquo;s very hard (or annoying) to enforce policies around phone use when no one else is, and having your phone out in school (and sometimes your earbuds) is just a ubiquitous part of student life.</p>
<p>The difference is that a couple of years ago, if you didn&rsquo;t pay attention in class, it would be hard to do a project, or write an essay, or pass a quiz.</p>
<p>Now? Most exams can be gamed unless you have extremely tight supervision (somewhat unrealistic in a world of asynchronous and hybrid courses).</p>
<p>Most student essays (like your typical 5 paragraph literary analysis on Romeo and Juliet) can be generated by a large language model. With some iterative prompting and other tricks (which students are already getting good at), it may not even sound like stock AI text anymore.</p>
<p>To be clear, these essays are not &ldquo;good.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve generated a bunch just to experiment. They&rsquo;re boring and lack any sort of style or character, and when you try to apply a particular &ldquo;style&rdquo; using prompting it can get even more ridiculous.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t matter. These assignments, historically, aren&rsquo;t about style. They aren&rsquo;t supposed be interesting. They&rsquo;re about &ldquo;showing what you know.&rdquo; Easily gameable.</p>
<p>And honestly, who could blame these students?</p>
<p>I know if I was a high schooler, and I understood how to use generative AI better than my teachers&hellip; I would game the system, too. As it is, I barely read the assigned books in high school. Believe me, I wanted to, they sure seemed interesting&hellip; but, the adolescent brain doesn&rsquo;t plan very well, so I read the bare minimum that I would need to pass my classes (which it turns out, wasn&rsquo;t very much).</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m not alone in this. Back then, it was quite costly to get a &ldquo;cheat code&rdquo; like Cliff&rsquo;s notes. You had to really scour the web for something or you had to go buy a physical copy.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t tried to cheat on a literary essay in over 20 years, but I imagine it&rsquo;s infinitely easier now, generative AI aside.</p>
<p>As a result, we now have a bunch of folks, including myself, who are thinking about the future of not only assessment.</p>
<p>The other side of the coin is student engagement. The way our classrooms looked yesterday (and the way teachers are assessed) will be very different in the near future.</p>
