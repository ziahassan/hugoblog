            <p>I learned a fundamental truth about myself around Christmas in 1996.</p>
<p>That was the year that I convinced my dad to let me get a PlayStation for Christmas. The video game console had been out for a while, so I was late to the party. But it was fine because the most up-to-date system I owned was a Super Nintendo, which was outdated.</p>
<p>It worked. He agreed. We went to the video game store the weekend before Christmas and he bought me the PlayStation, along with a couple of games.</p>

<p>On my first day of kindergarten, I remember mindlessly singing Under the Sea from the little mermaid and getting destroyed by my table mates about it. I cried, the teacher intervened, and eventually those boys became my best friends growing up. But a feature of our relationship was them teasing me incessantly.</p>
<p>And as I grew up, it kept happening. My cousins, slightly older than me, made fun of me to the point at which I’d dread them coming to visit and would also at once be excited. My friends in 7th grade made fun of my lack of athletic ability, though this was also the year I really discovered singing, which counteracted the depression over a lack of sportsmanship.</p>

<p>I’ve been writing songs since I was 7. A family friend had given birth to a baby boy, and for whatever reason, I decided to write a song about it on piano. I don’t remember the process, though I do remember playing the song at recitals. My piano teacher even let me make sheet music for the song using Midi.</p>
<p>Then, when I was 13, I wrote a poem that an older friend turned into a song. What a special thing to do, collaborating on music and lyrics. Again, I don’t remember the process. This was also the year I bought a guitar. And though I didn’t know how to tune it or play it, just its presence made me feel at ease. Like how some people feel about sleeping with a gun under their pillow except slightly less intense.</p>

<p>If you’ve never been in a rain storm in Arizona, it can be quite intense for a short period of time, and then out of nowhere, the clouds will vanish and the sun will return, like nothing ever happened. It’s almost as if someone hit the reset button, right as the storm started to peak.</p>
<p>I was in Tucson recently for one of these storms, so I took shelter. Afterward, I went for a walk by a pond, over a bridge. And as I crossed over the bridge, I noticed in the sky the stretchiest, most pot-of-gold looking rainbow I had ever seen in my life.</p>

            <p>Maybe it’s fatherhood. Maybe it’s living in a house that I feel completely aligns with my taste and my character. Maybe it’s working a job that I absolutely love. Either way, I feel happy lately. I wake up every morning excited to be alive, excited to be a father and a husband, and excited to take on whatever challenges the day presents.</p>
<p>One interesting sensation that’s developed in the past few months is the feeling of what I describe as a heart tickle. It’s almost a sense of longing ness, like leaving someone you won’t see for a while, except they’re standing right there. It’s the wistful sensation of missing someone before they’ve even gone away. I don’t know what spurred it, or why it’s been so prevalent in my life lately.</p>
