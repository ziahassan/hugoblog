            <p>When I was a kid, I was obsessed with hurricanes and tornadoes.</p>
<p>“If there’s ever a tornado warning,” my mother told me with wide eyes, “then we’ll have to head to the basement where it’s safe. A tornado watch means we just need to be alert.”</p>
<p>So I developed the belief that if there was ever a tornado warning, that we were doomed and the house was going to be crushed by a twister. I was so obsessed that <em>any</em> time the sky turned dark, I would pick up the phone (in the 90’s the internet wasn’t as helpful) and dial my local weather call-in number, which would play back a recorded message. A low growly man would tell me whether or not imminent doom was possible.</p>

<p>I’ve written before about how songs seem to come to me gift-wrapped. That is, they’ll appear out of nowhere, fully formed with a melody and a core idea, and it will take very little refining on my part to beat them into shape.</p>
<p>There is some truth to the idea that inspiration is spurred by simply sitting down to work. I’ve written some songs this way, like when I have a custom song to write for a wedding and the deadline is soon approaching. The downside to this approach, of course, is that some of those songs are ones that I’m not inspired by and I never play again. Some, very few, become hits.</p>

            <p>The first time I wrote a song I was seven years old. My parents had recently gotten a piano in our basement and I made up some simple melody on thee piano that ended up being performed at my piano recital.</p>
<p>My teacher had told me a secret: you can play any song you want, as long as you know the notes. I figured the same must be true for songwriting, except… how do you know the notes to a song you’ve never heard?</p>

            <p>It was 1998. I was living in Egypt and I had taken up acting and singing at school and finally felt like I had a place in my community. For the first time ever, I was accepted (or whatever the closest version of accepted is in middle school) by a group of peers.</p>
<p>My best friend at the time considered himself a playwright, but I didn’t take him seriously until he submitted a play under a pseudonym to a contest at a local university. He won, which meant his play was to be produced, and I went with him to the auditions.</p>

            <p>Seeing Austin Kleon tonight at Politics and Prose was highly enjoyable. He has such interesting thoughts and I love his books. Not to mention, his blackout poetry is really creative.</p>
<p>One of the things he said that really stuck with me was the idea of making gifts. That we we will sometimes see a friend’s good art and then say that they should make an Etsy store or, in my case, try out for American Idol.</p>
