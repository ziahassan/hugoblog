            <p>Tonight, Kellyn, Andy, and I sat outside on a really clear night, and over the course of their visit the clouds lowered and there was strong fog everywhere. It made me really inspired to compose something from the eyes of the frog on the wall, who saw the whole thing. So, the next piece in the Still Life record. There&rsquo;s a bit of silence at the beginning and end because I&rsquo;m tired and haven&rsquo;t been able to edit it. This picture is from a flickr page.</p>

            <p>It&rsquo;s been a little over a week since I arrived in the UK, but it feels much longer due to the way I&rsquo;ve worked out our living schedule. This entry could be quite long, so I&rsquo;ve marked it with subheadings. Feel free to pick and choose, or to carry on with your day at work or wherever you may be.</p>
<p>Arrival at Heathrow&rsquo;s and Riz Mamoo&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Day 1: My flight was delayed about an hour due to an indication problem. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what that meant but we had to refuel at one point. Anyway, they played the news (BBC) and then got on to the movies. The selection was pretty weak, so I ended up starting off with Freedomland, where Julianne Moore and Sammy L. do something dramatic, and then I moved on to Last Vacation, where Queen Latifah and LL Cool J attempted to be comedic. Still can&rsquo;t believe that LL would think himself good enough to be on screen. Read for a little bit (social life of information) and slept maybe an hour. The flight was 6.5 hours, much shorter than normal, and much shorter than the return flight, which is scheduled for 8 hours now.</p>

            <p>Over the couse of the year, I noticed that time was moving forward at a breakneck pace. I thought maybe it was factors like my classes being later in the day (spending more time sleeping, less time awake). But in the summer, I&rsquo;m waking up at 7 every day, and it&rsquo;s still flying by very quickly.</p>
<p>Two nights ago, on the brink of May 31st, we had a small get together at my house, to bring in Andy&rsquo;s birthday. I invited Kevin, who I haven&rsquo;t really talked to in almost a decade. He was kind enough to bring a sixpack of Negro. All of us had a great time, and the air was really warm. We saw a flicker of fireflies in the trees – a preview for what will come in July. Around midnight, we decided to get some fast food. Stood in the drive through at Wendy&rsquo;s with no significant outcome. Chris drove us there like a soccer mom in his station wagon.</p>

<p>It was hot today. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scorchingly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Killingly hot. For the first time this year, I felt the Sauna of my car as I sat down, the stickiness of the steering wheel burning my skin off, avoiding the seatbelt as I clicked in. And that lovely two-minute wait between total AC oasis and standing-on-the-sun boil.<br>
Friday night: Chris and I went to Tower and I bought a random Eno DVD, two video paintings that ended up being quite strange and I don&rsquo;t know if it was worth the money I spent. We sat on the deck with no hookah for once, but we drank beer instead. Heineken Light and Corona. We watched &ldquo;What the @#%$ do we know?&rdquo; and I fell asleep, even though I love that movie.</p>

            <p>This week was fast, this day has gone really fast, this year went by the fastest. It feels like decades ago now, last summer with my trip to Minneapolis, Astronomy class, RA training, saying goodbye to everyone. At the same time, I didn&rsquo;t know this is how empty being a senior feels. I still have 10 more classes to take, and since they&rsquo;re intense, I expect to be satisfied from what I learn next year.</p>
