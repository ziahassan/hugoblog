<p>Teacher training is an interesting place to be in August. Right before the school year starts, teachers are a bit more relaxed and they have a natural curiosity and sense of exploration as they begin to tackle the new school year.</p>
<p>At one school in which I taught, we were asked to analyze some articles as part of our pre-service (meaning the professional development we do before students arrive). We were then asked to pair up and discuss the articles using a discussion guide. The guide would walk us through a discussion where would make assertions, arguments, and agreements about different parts of the article.</p>

<p>When I moved into my new house last year, there was an interesting phenomenon that I noticed. Every time I’d mention to someone that I bought a new desk or a crib for my upcoming child, I’d get the response: “I’m sure you’re super busy and I’d love to come and build it for you.”</p>
<p>At first, I thought it was just my incredible generous friends and family offering their time to take some of the burden off of my wife and I. And surely it was, at least partially. But no one was chomping at the bit to help us more our furniture, or scrub the bathrooms… overwhelmingly, they simply wanted to build our furniture that we had purchased from Ikea or Wayfair.</p>

            <p>I’m a huge fan of routines in general. I learned as a teacher is that routines are comforting to children <em>and</em> adults. It seems obvious, yet we rarely think about how we can use routines strategically.</p>
<p>One popular way that designing a routine has become a bit more mainstream is the idea of a morning routine, or the actions we take when we rise each morning. Drink a warm glass of lemon water, do yoga, write in a journal, eat a small meal. Do it every day when you wake up, and your day will continue to have some kind of structure.</p>

            <p>“Don’t let anyone steal your joy.”</p>
<p>This was a phrase written in permanent ink on the teacher’s board in the copy room of a school I worked at. It made sense for a school setting for teachers, who have their joy stolen constantly by basically everyone, including people outside of their job who think they understand their jobs.</p>
<p>For years, I was convinced not to let anyone do this to me. I figured a good attitude could keep it from happening. But then it happened. At one point my joy was stolen. I won’t get into the specifics of how, but the joy of what I did every single day was deliberately stolen.</p>

<p>You haven’t felt this for quite a while.</p>
<p>You’re at the party and it seems to be endless. Due to the nature of the fact that you’re intoxicated and also among your best friends, time seems to slow. Not to mention you’re younger, maybe in your 20’s.</p>
<p>The music’s loud, the booze is everywhere, there are people in a bedroom next door to you doing something or other, and in another room there’s a dance party of two. And all the while, you wonder if this is life from now on: working for the man and having get togethers on the weekend. No one’s ready to leave because no one has kids to get home to, and in fact, no one here really has a pet either so this could go on for a while.</p>
