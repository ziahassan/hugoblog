            <p>think I&rsquo;m Bi Polar. Honestly. Tonight started off in the worst mood ever. I felt like shit, and like I had no friends. Then for some reason all of a sudden that attitude changed and I felt really happy. I feel like bouncing off the walls. If I&rsquo;m not bi polar, there is definetely something wrong with me. How can a person go from a really really sad state to a really happy state within like an hour?? I won&rsquo;t question it. It&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>

            <p>Today was a pretty interesting day. Once again I had that weird feeling in my gut that something was wrong. Christine tried to convince me it&rsquo;s just the end of the semester blues. It should all go away once the craziness is gone in a couple of days.</p>
<p>I have a math quiz tommorow and I don&rsquo;t know a single thing. Some would say that I&rsquo;m screwed. I shut off the vent in my house and it is still freezing cold.</p>

<p>I wanted those headphones that they had in store, the Koss Td-80&rsquo;s. The sound is phenomenal on those baby&rsquo;s. I went out and bought them and they sucked. So uncomfortable. So I traded them in for the newer model. I wear them now but I just put on my old sony&rsquo;s. What a warm sound. Sure it&rsquo;s a little muddy sometimes‚Ä¶ but it&rsquo;s so comfortable. You really forget that they are on your head. I need create a headphone one day that does what the TD-80 does, with the comfort of the Sony&rsquo;s. You think that the Koss people would take that into account when they are making their phones! But no.</p>

            <p>It&rsquo;s been a fantastic day.</p>
<p>I woke up at like 11 and hung around in my house till 2. I picked Christine up and we went to eat at subway, and then went to White Flint, cuz she had a Borders gift certificate. She was in between a journal, Dante&rsquo;s Inferno, and some other stuff, and ended up just buying a book that is all about trashy movies üôÇ The guy at the register gave her 10% off. I thought it was neat.</p>

            <p>It&rsquo;s Saturday morning and I feel so much better. Everything that was bugging me yesterday stopped bugging me. I just sorta took a look around and realized where I was and I was happy.</p>
<p>Chris, Christine, and I played Literati last night online‚Ä¶ I didn&rsquo;t know you could use wild cards! I thought they were just unusable‚Ä¶ so I was like 20 points behind the whole game. But if I hadn&rsquo;t been I woulda whooped some ass. Chris won the game, and it was really close to. The last move was up to him and he had 149 and Christine had 154‚Ä¶ and he jumped ahead to 160 and used all his letters. It was QUITE the game. I felt like a spectator‚Ä¶I basically gave up in the middle of the game.<br>
PJ and Chris and I all hung out last night. We went to Starbucks and also to Taco Bell (where of course we saw the wootteners that are always at Taco Bell) and then we just chilled for a little bit. It was exactly the type of evening I was looking for.</p>
