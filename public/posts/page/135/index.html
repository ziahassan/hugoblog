<p>Quarter to six and I&rsquo;m sitting in my room eating noodles. The weekend has begun.</p>
<p>Today was a really horrible day. I started off by telling Christine about how I thought it was going to be a terrible day for some reason, and she disagreed, and said that my day is only as good as I think it&rsquo;s going to be. So if I think it&rsquo;s going to bad it&rsquo;ll be bad, and vice versa. But I guess I was right.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lotta tension in my house right now. And I&rsquo;m in my stomach. God I&rsquo;m hungry. There&rsquo;s never anything to eat though, my mom either buys reallly crappy food or total junk food. Well junk food it is. Be right back.</p>
<p>My sister is bawling in my parents room for no particular reason. I hate it when she does this. She just moans and whines and doesn&rsquo;t stop complaining about how horrible life is. Granted I&rsquo;ve been in that position, but she just needs to realize where she is.</p>

<p>  A very eventful day in the life of the Z.</p>
<p>I woke up at 5:15, COMPLETELY expecting a 2 hour delay. The worst thing is, my mom walked in my room and started picking stuff up off the ground without saying anything… I figured maybe she was letting me sleep, since it was a 2 hour delay. Then she said &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t about time to get up?&rdquo; I was so mad. All I wanted was two more hours of sleep. I am really staying up late these days. I mean it&rsquo;s like 11:15 right now. That is late for me. My eyes are completely bloodshot.</p>

<p>God it&rsquo;s way too late to be up, yet I am.</p>
<p>Today was Monday, a snowday, and it was a pretty good day all in all. I woke up around 11 or so and had a bagel for breakfast. And jesus, I just realized I haven&rsquo;t gotten out of the house at all.</p>
<p>Then I took David&rsquo;s lyrics and worked the shit out of them. The guy&rsquo;s got such talent… I wanted to write some music to the lyrics that worked and made a tune that did the lyrics justice. So I worked from like… 2-7 on it. Took about 2 hours to get the tracks down and about another 3 to mix the whole thing. The hardest thing was placing the beat in it so that it worked. And getting rid of some lyrics that might&rsquo;ve been important to him. Then I had to add another verse… truly a dual effort. So today&rsquo;s been quite productive, and I feel really good about the recording. He hears it tommorow… will get the verdict then.</p>

            <p>I never thought I&rsquo;d start writing in my LiveJournal again EVER, but here I am again. In case you&rsquo;re reading this, and wondering why I go around talking shit about livejournals and how they are for people who complain and shit… maybe people need that outlet. But here&rsquo;s the deal… any complaining, or negative thinking that&rsquo;s gonna occur will happen in a private entry. So the venting stays in the vent. And I&rsquo;m disabling commenting. You can probably guess why, I don&rsquo;t need comments on my life. But I mean that in a positive way. I swear that is a good thing. Any stuff that I think the public would find interesting or thoughful will remain public. And just like before, if you don&rsquo;t like, don&rsquo;t read. I have to admit though, I don&rsquo;t think anyone will care to read this. And I say that out of sheer honesty. And also in completely honesty, that&rsquo;s completely irrelevant. The basis of this journal are MY thoughts and MY emotions.</p>
