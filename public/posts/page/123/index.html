            <p>Idea: collect artifacts from your lifetime and make a museum. You can make your life an exhibit, and the rest of your family can do the same, creating a museum of family culture. A living, breathing, interactive space for people to learn about your history.</p>
<p>Mine would have: strollers, shoes, my fisher-price phonograph, my trampoline, my bunk bed, the radial nerve splint, some clothes that were staples, Mr. Peanut, blue bear, that Orbitz drink, my old boombox. Each would have a tag describing what nook that particular item fit into, why it was important.</p>

<p>The rain finally let up yesterday morning, and I drove to work happily, without the fear of someone skidding into me. Read an interesting Eno story the other day which I’d never heard before.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In January this year I had an accident. I was not seriously hurt, but I was confined to bed in a stiff and static position. My friend Judy Nylon visited me and brought me a record of 18th century harp music. After she had gone, and with some considerable difficulty, I put on the record. Having laid down, I realized that the amplifier was set at an extremely low level, and that one channel of the stereo had failed completely. Since I hadn’t the energy to get up and improve matters, the record played on almost inaudibly. This presented what was for me a new way of hearing music – as part of the ambience of the environment just as the colour of the light and the sound of the rain were parts of that ambience. It is for this reason that I suggest listening to the piece at comparatively low levels, even to the extent that it frequently falls below the threshold of audibility.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

            <p>18 years ago, I was most likely jumping on my trapoline in the basement, an activity which I performed until I got tired. Then, I would take my Fisher-Price phonograph and pull out a random LP from my dad’s collection, and it was generally one that I hadn’t heard before, or didn’t even like, but if the cover was appealing, I would always give it another shot. That was how we bought LPs, dad and I. He would put me on his shoulders and I would select an album based on the artwork. Much easier to do with LPs because of their size – my 2 year old eyes could see everything so vividly. In fact, when we transitioned into CDs, I was horribly upset at the size of the CDs that I didn’t want any despite the fact that our only phonograph was a $20 Fisher-Price and my dad had invested a few thousand dollars in a soundsystem with a cd player.</p>

            <p>I&rsquo;ve had to put together about 3 binders today.  The rest of the day I&rsquo;ve sat around listening to music and reading about synthesizers.  I did find a cool website called longnow.org which has lectures about forward thinking.  Stewart Brand created this orgnization who found it interesting that different people of different cultures envisioned the concept of &ldquo;now&rdquo; very differently.  </p>
<p>If you asked someone what they were working on &ldquo;now,&rdquo; would they refer to what they&rsquo;ve been doing that hour?  That morning?  That year?  The Long Now organization has decided to make &ldquo;now&rdquo; encompass the next 10,000 years.  They&rsquo;ve even made a clock that plays bells.  They have all of their lectures on the site, and I was listening to the kick-off speech from Eno.  He began by talking about his first ambient record (discreet music, which I still haven&rsquo;t heard), and then went onto the other ambient ones and explained why they relate to time and &ldquo;now.&rdquo;  </p>

            <p>I might as well mention that London was full of fun. It was hot, and I hadn&rsquo;t brought clothes for that sort of climate. No one in the UK has Air Conditioning either, so that didn&rsquo;t make things any better. Liza came for a quick detour through DC before she went back to Minneapolis, and I won&rsquo;t see her for another couple of months. I feel as if everytime we say hello, it&rsquo;s goodbye again.</p>
