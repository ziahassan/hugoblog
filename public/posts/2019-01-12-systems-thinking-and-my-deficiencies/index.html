        <p>We’re all born with gifts, and we’re all born with anti-gifts. Skills that seem to come naturally to others but are a total mystery to us.</p>
<p>One of those, for me, is Tetris. Being able to fit pieces into gaps, being able to think ahead in a spatial way… are not skills in which I excel.</p>
<p>I’m also bad at having a thick skin. As a highly sensitive person, this never came naturally to me. Other things that never came naturally include being organized and punctual. Maybe it was nature, maybe nurture, but it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>Somewhere around college, I’d had enough of being late with things, forgetting appointments, and letting people down. So I started reading about the GTD system, which I’ve written about many times, and implementing not only changed my life, but I would argue it saved my life.</p>
<p>It was the first “system” I’d ever tried, and the results were monumental and still help me today, 15 or so years later. I became obsessed. What other systems might help me fill in the gaps that my deficiencies have left me with?</p>
<p>To name a few:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Konmarie tidying system could help me organize my physical objects more effectively, though I haven’t really implemented it fully.</li>
<li>A weight training program, like New Rules of Lifting, has helped me tremendously. I no longer need to figure out what to do at the gym. I follow the prescribed steps, and I see results.</li>
<li>Meal kit systems like Hello Fresh or Plated have taught me how to cook after years and years of trying.</li>
<li>Goal and Habit Trackers, and the so-called Seinfeld system, or don’t break the chain, has helped me stay active in my projects (in addition to having a functional to do list).</li>
<li>The system outlined in The Power of Habits by Charles Duhigg has helped me to change my habits in ways that I was oblivious to before.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, any time that I need to make a huge change to my life, I create some kind of system. When my son was born, I developed a system for keeping our house tidy so that we wouldn’t raise him living in clutter. It’s probably something that a naturally organized and tidy person wouldn’t need, but I have tried for years to stay tidy with no luck. So far, we’ve gotten lots of surprised faces at how clean our house is when people come over.</p>
<p>When I worked in the classroom, my students can tell you that we had a <em>ton</em> of systems. One of them, for instance, included see through folders on the wall, one for each student in alphabetical order, for them to turn in work. I could see whose work was missing, and collect the papers in alphabetical order, which reduced the cognitive effort needed to input the grades into a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>I developed a system for giving feedback on 4th grade essays which was pretty complex, but it allowed me to enter in multiple rubric scores and automatically generate a checklist and paragraph of feedback for each student. I could grade 60 one-paragraph papers in about 20 minutes on a good day, whereas the process used to take hours.</p>
<p>I outline my process for making a system as such:</p>
<ul>
<li>I figure out what my system will automate in my life. Even if it’s not technology oriented, instilling a habit so that a process is nearly automatic (like brushing your teeth every morning) takes away the cognitive load.</li>
<li>I do research to figure out what may have worked for other people.</li>
<li>I figure out the exact steps and frequency of the steps needed to achieve a functional habit loop or system where I don’t need to intervene too much.</li>
<li>I implement it and scale it and review it. If it works, I keep it, and if it’s not working, I adjust it.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many people who laugh at the lengths I go through to create and maintain these systems, but that’s because they’re missing the point. The point of these systems is to make life a little less chaotic, yes, but it’s also to remove a lot of unnecessary thinking so that I can focus on being a creative parent and consultant.</p>
<p>This is not always easy work. In fact, it’s difficult quite often. There are some systems I’ve been tweaking for years.</p>
<p>But… it is a lot better than waking up every day and trying to tackle the day in an improvisatory way.</p>
