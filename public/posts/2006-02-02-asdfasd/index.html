        <p>Maybe everything is alright. Maybe what I percieve other people to percieve me as is irrelevant. I was considering what I would write in a letter to be opened after my death. That sounds morbid, and somewhat emo, but nonetheless I was thinking about what I&rsquo;d write. One of those things you think about but you don&rsquo;t talk about over lunch. My final decision is not to have a letter. Does that make sense? I&rsquo;m never hesitant to publish some thoughts to a website during my lifetime, but I think when I die, if it&rsquo;s mysterious, then I want to maintain some of that mystery forever.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided that this summer I want to build a robot. I want to save up, buy the parts, assemble the robot, and then write scripts to make the robot do things. In 8th grade, Sam and I wrote a program that made a robotic arm move blocks from one side of the desk to the other. Then, Whitney built a laser and no one cared about our robot anymore.</p>
<p>Mike arranged Out of the Woods for OASN to perform, and I swear that was probably the best moment of my week. I had forgotten how good that song is. Amazing how young that group is, or was when they recorded their debut. It brought me back to the summer when a few friends and I went to see Nickel Creek perform at the Kennedy Center on a long and winding adventure.</p>
<p>I had stopped watching the progress of my hand and fingers and all of a sudden I realized that they&rsquo;re almost back to full strength. The thumb and pointer are still a little droopy, but I can finger pick again.</p>
<p>I have to finish watching the Godfather tonight. It&rsquo;s one of those movies that every guy I know has memorized, and I figured it&rsquo;s about time I grow up. The first step, learning to enjoy football, was easy. I&rsquo;m pretty fluent now, and my reason for wanting the Steelers to win the superbowl is not because they&rsquo;re good (that&rsquo;s <em>never</em> a reason to like a team), but it&rsquo;s because the Seahawks beat the Redskins. So they should lose the superbowl. Does that make sense?</p>
