        <p>I found it on Amazon for $50. It was a cool looking one that seems to stick on a wall.</p>
<p>It was a little bit for me – I had a stack of CDs from High School that my parents had kept at their house until recently. It felt nice to pull from a CD wallet instead of going on Spotify or some other app and letting its algorithm influence my choice of what to listen to.</p>
<p>But it was mostly for my son. Everyone cultivates their own taste in music, and no one ever dismisses music altogether (do they?), therefore I feel that it’s important that he has a finite collection of music to explore instead of a universe of smart tags and metadata rewiring his brain.</p>
<p>It would also allow me to introduce him to bands and artists. He may not enjoy them as much, but at least it’s there if he ever needs it.</p>
<p>There’s more wisdom, more than you realize, that can be found in a 12-track album that had a one-hit wonder. There are songs there that were never meant to be fully played. Where artists could be at their most vulernable, for better or worse. Try listening to the <em>other</em> tracks on a Bush album, or on a Verve Pipe album.</p>
<p>But in today’s music industry, people release singles with the same gusto we used to reserve for full albums.</p>
<p>And surely my son will find his way to online streaming music one day, probably sooner than I realize.</p>
<p>But to start with music, everyone could use a walled garden to live in for a time. To sit in the grass and learn every piece of dirt.</p>
<p>That’s what the CD collection offers – a chance to sit down and observe. Not driving, not mindlessly listening on the subway, but actually paying attention. Also, a compact disc also integrated artwork, that is part of the physical disc itself. That physical disc that you put into a player, that you watch spin and melt into a pond of colors. A disc that has actual <em>tracks</em> where the songs live, that you can see when you look closely.</p>
<p>We keep searching for the infinite because we don’t realize just how much beauty is in the finite.</p>
