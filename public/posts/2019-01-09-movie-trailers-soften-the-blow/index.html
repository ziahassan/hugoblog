I used to love movie trailers as a kid.
So much that I’d be upset if I was late and missed even one of them. There was something magical to me about the telling of these mini-stories. I loved following up by seeing the movie advertised and would get excited when I’d notice a scene from the trailer and how it fit into the film.

<p>I used to love movie trailers as a kid.</p>
<p>So much that I’d be upset if I was late and missed even one of them. There was something magical to me about the telling of these mini-stories. I loved following up by seeing the movie advertised and would get excited when I’d notice a scene from the trailer and how it fit into the film.</p>
<p>Until it all changed one day, when I saw the movie Room. I won’t say what it’s about to avoid spoilers and also because it doesn’t matter what it was about. What made the experience of Room different for me was that I <em>didnt see the trailer</em>. In fact, I hadn’t heard or watched anything about it, despite the fact that it was based on a book.</p>
<p>If you’ve seen the film, then you know just how jarring that must have been. It was the most unbelievable experience. I was literally on the edge of my seat. I had <em>zero</em> idea what I was in for. If I had, the blow would’ve been softened. And I don’t want soft blows when it comes to movies.</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve realized that all trailers do essentially the same thing: they tell the story of the movie, with most of the key scenes, and leave out the ending. Good thing, because otherwise there’d be no need to see the film.</p>
<p>But if a movie requires 2 hours to tell a story and previews are able to condense the story into 2 mins to entice viewers to see it, then aren’t we being exposed to elements of s story without the details? And doesn’t that affect how we receive the movie when we watch it for the first time?</p>
<p>I’m not saying we should do away with trailers. One great trailer was for the Man on Wire movie, which simply showed the character high up on a skyscraper, about to walk across a tightrope. But then, that was a bio pic, so not much “story” was needed to entice viewers. Imagine doing the same idea but for a rom com. Not as effective.</p>
<p>It would make more sense, perhaps, to just share a one min scene from the movie. This is maybe less enticing, but with a good movie, this could be effective in drawing in viewers <em>and</em> not give it all away. Imagine seeing just the first scene of Up for instance. It’s enough to make you want to stay for the rest. It’s a radical idea, but the current style of movie trailers can ruin the experience of a truly good film by laying out the story structure in your mind before you actually see the movie.</p>
<p>We changed the style of previews once before by ditching narration. I say let’s do it again.</p>
