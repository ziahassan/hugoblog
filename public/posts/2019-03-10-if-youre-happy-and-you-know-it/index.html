Except, how do you know when you’re happy? And can you be happy without knowing it?
I suppose I was happy without knowing it for years. When I used to work a desk job (sitting at a cubicle all day), I felt like my life had no meaning or purpose. And it’s likely that the job I had was not in line with who I wanted to be at the time. I would’ve described myself as unhappy. I would tell people I had no passion for my job.

        <p>… clap your hands.</p>
<p>Except, how do you know when you’re happy? And can you be happy without knowing it?</p>
<p>I suppose I was happy without knowing it for years. When I used to work a desk job (sitting at a cubicle all day), I felt like my life had no meaning or purpose. And it’s likely that the job I had was not in line with who I wanted to be at the time. I would’ve described myself as unhappy. I would tell people I had no passion for my job.</p>
<p>When I left to become a teacher, I had <em>loads</em> of passion for my job… but it was so mentally and physically draining that I wouldn’t have described myself as happy during that time. Maybe satisfied, but not happy.</p>
<p>And now that I have a job that is flexible and just the right amount of work/life balance, I tell people I’m the happiest I’ve ever been. That could also have to do with having a child, because that is an act that increases happiness by leaps and bounds.</p>
<p>But was it really the job that made me happy? Or was it just the story I was telling myself?</p>
<p>Because as the song goes…</p>
<p><em>If you’re happy and you know it, clap your hands…</em></p>
<p>As a child, I never refused to clap my hands when I’ve heard this song. I never took a mental inventory to assess my level of happiness. In fact, even if I was in a stormy mood, I’d still clap my hands because the song doesn’t make much sense otherwise. It’s a built-in participatory move. It’s almost impulsive, subconscious.</p>
<p>And that’s the trick.</p>
<p>By clapping your hands without thinking about it, you’ve agreed to being happy. We clap our hands because we are happy and know it, but we are happy <em>because</em> we clap our hands. It’s the perfect feedback loop.</p>
<p>It’s like how research shows that smiling automatically makes us happier. It’s not about the jobs we have or the events in our life, necessarily. Happiness is a mode. Clapping is one trigger, but there are many others.</p>
<p>Happiness can be <em>turned on.</em></p>
