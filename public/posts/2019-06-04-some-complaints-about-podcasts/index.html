  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>Podcasts are slowly becoming my favorite medium, and from talking to friends and family, it seems I’m not the only one. I started listening to podcasts back in the dark ages of 2010, before Serial. And I even spent time producing <a href="mixcloud.com/ziahassan">my own</a> back in 2011, interviewing whomever I could, and telling whatever stories I could possibly come up with.</p>
<p>Then Serial came out, with its NPR sleekness and vocal fry, and what followed was somewhat of a podcasting revolution. Blogs fell out of fashion, and even videos (which at one point were seen as the <em>new new hotness</em>) were taking a backseat to podcasts.</p>
<p>Suddenly there were cool new apps to play podcasts, and there were podcasts about extremely nuanced and complex topics. There’s even one on fountain pens, if you can believe it.</p>
<p>This is pretty cool. When you hear someone talking about a subject you’re passionate about weekly, it can sometimes feel like you’ve gained a new, interesting and intellectual friend. It feels a bit like you know them. And the podcasts that are done exceedingly well are as addicting as anything else online, but they feel much more organic and less scripted.</p>
<p>But with that said, I have some complaints.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Audio quality. Since it’s easy to get sound into a computer these days, many people think it’s okay to skimp on a quality system. People don’t worry about acoustics in the room, vocal tone, EQ, or even putting a goddamn pop filter on the microphone (the thing that stops your plosives from being so explosive).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Too close to radio. There are some podcasts I’ve listened to that have crazy music playing in the background while the commentator shouts like it’s a monster truck rally. This may have been a good way to conduct business in the days of FM radio, where louder signaled more professional, but we live in a world of iPod earbuds and personal audio experiences. It’s safe to say that some of the best podcasts are the ones that feel like you’re sitting in a room and listening to someone have a conversation. Audience of one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Too much like a blog. Since we use feeds to get our latest fix of a podcast, it gets <em>really</em> annoying when podcasters post 4-5 episodes at a time (looking at you Dave Ramsey). This was fine when we had Tumblr blogs that we could skim through, but podcasts don’t skim quite as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who aren’t great speakers. It’s a skill that anyone can probably develop, but many podcasters haven’t yet. Just having interesting topics to discuss doesn’t mean that the podcast medium is right for you.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Podcasts are still probably the best medium right now and I fully support anyone wanting to create, well, anything. But I think we need to keep these things in mind as we move forward. It doesn’t cost a lot to get decent audio equipment, to get feedback on your vocal performance, and to be concise with your content.</p>
