  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>A friend of mine came over recently and was playing some of my guitars (I have 8 of them).</p>
<p>He picked up a vintage acoustic, one from the 70s that I had picked up used on eBay a few years ago, and examined it closely.</p>
<p>“Ew! The neck of this guitar is <em>covered</em> in dead skin cells. Want me to try to clean this off for you?”</p>
<p>I had noticed that the neck was a bit gross looking, but hadn’t realized that what I was looking at was literally the skin cells of the player(s) who used this guitar before me.</p>
<p>Gross. And yet…</p>
<p>There’s something special about an instrument that has been previously owned and played, particularly a guitar.</p>
<p>The guitar has been a conduit for so many stories. So many emotions that couldn’t be expressed in mere words or with a simple memo. So many characters and settings. So much frustration, joy, and wonder have vibrated through its spruce top.</p>
<p>And all those stories, like pieces of fruit in a juicer, leave marks behind. Residue of life, stories, music, soul. Units of residue. Cells.</p>
<p>When I pick up the guitar, my palms rub against that rough coating on the back of the neck (though my friend did try to clean it).</p>
<p>And I hear the essence of those stories, of those melodies. I hear the essence of all the heartbreak and repair and curiosity and joy that went into someone’s art.</p>
<p>And I’m inspired.</p>
<p>So now when I play my modern guitars, I press a little harder with my palms on the back of the neck.</p>
<p>To pay it forward to the next owner, years from now, trying to bare their soul through wood and steel.</p>
