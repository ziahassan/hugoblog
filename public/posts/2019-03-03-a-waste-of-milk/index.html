        <p>When I was growing up, my mom was obsessed with making my sister and I drink milk. In fact, we bookended our day with milk. A cup in the morning, a full glass in the evening.</p>
<p>We were told dairy industry lies, somehow convincing ourselves that milk would “do our body good” and would make us grow bigger and stronger somehow.</p>
<p>Another thing that was characteristic about my childhood was stomach aches. It may have been childhood anxiety (I had quite a bit of it) or it may have been the copious amounts of milk I drank every day.</p>
<p>I got a little break from the milk in middle school when my family lived overseas in Egypt. I felt better then.</p>
<p>When we moved back for high school, things were different. Gone were the days of eating together at the table with a glass of milk pre-poured and waiting for me next to my pop-tart.</p>
<p>I rarely even ate breakfast in high school. Instead, I’d wake up and barely have time for a shower before I was out the door. I usually didn’t even eat my first bite until the predetermined snack time in high school, about 10:30.</p>
<p>So my mom would leave that glass of milk on the bathroom counter. She wanted me to drink it after my shower. But drinking the milk made my stomach hurt and I had finally made the connection. So unbeknownst to her, every single day… I poured that glass of milk directly down the bathroom sink.</p>
<p>I’ve done the math. If there were 8 oz in the glass every day, and 180 school days in a year, and 4 years of high school… then I poured about _45 gallons_of milk down the drain over the course of high school.</p>
<p>It’s amazing how much milk I wasted. And how that milk would’ve been wasted if I had consumed it anyway. A waste of something that is already kind of a waste itself.</p>
<p>This story is a clear illustration of the reasons to re-examine our behavior, our patterns, our beliefs. We all believed drinking milk would reap huge benefits, but it turns out it was just making many of us sick every day.</p>
<p>We’ve since expanded our knowledge, but I guarantee there’s a habit in your life that you believe in with the same conviction that my mother had in the power of milk.</p>
