        <p>I’ve always had this weird obsession with robots and artificial intelligence. I would scour the internet looking for new apps that could respond to what I’m saying with some shred of intelligence and I would try to write programs that would seem intelligent. The biggest thrill of my life came from a program I wrote (in Basic) that would ask you for your name, and then spit it back to you in the form of some salutation.

Eight years later, I’m still a technology geek, but I’m not amazed by the little improvements anymore.

<p>I’ve been having this feeling lately: I’ve forgotten something. That state where you can’t remember what you’re supposed to be remembering. Maybe it’s because I’ve been doing a better job of capturing everything lately, and it almost seems like a trap. Or I really am forgetting something or someone.</p>
