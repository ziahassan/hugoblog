        <p>Middle School is when everything your parents say makes no sense to you, when your friends become enemies and enemies become friends at the drop of a hat, and you have to start thinking, at least a little bit, about growing from a child to an adult. You also have to remember a locker code, or at least I did when I was a teenager.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to spend some of these formative years in Cairo, Egypt. It was an interesting time, because I was going through puberty quicker and sooner than almost everyone else. I had full facial hair by age 13, which made me a freak show and a hero all at the same time. It’s awkward to live your pre-teen years looking and acting more like a teen teen.</p>
<p>Living in Egypt, my parents rarely signed me up for anything against my will. Sure, when I was younger there was a slew of swimming lessons, and soccer practice, and piano, and summer camp. But in Middle School they laid off me a bit, and let me figure out what to do with my time.</p>
<p>But one night they sat me down and told me they had arranged for horseback riding lessons every Sunday afternoon in Giza for about 4-5 months.</p>
<p>I fought against this vehemently. One of the things that really irked me as a middle schooler was being forced to do <em>anything</em>, let alone something that would take up my precious Sunday evening which was usually reserved for listening to music and playing video games.</p>
<p>But they made me. They said I’d thank them later.</p>
<p>And so our driver (it was common to have one living in Egypt as an expat) took my sister, me, and a couple friends to Giza, listening to a Third Eye Blind tape along the way. I grumbled the entire way.</p>
<p>What business did my parents have in telling me what to do? And what did they know about what I’d like or wouldn’t like? I was nearly an adult now, after all. I know what I like. And it’s not riding on a horse on a Sunday evening.</p>
<p>Annoyed, I got on my horse and after a basic orientation, and we took off with a guide into the desert. It was 5pm or so, which meant that as we rode, the sun began to set.</p>
<p>If you’ve never witnessed the sunset in the desert, the only word I can use to describe it is <em>spectacular</em>. With a wide open area and no other structures than pyramids to block the sunset, it felt like riding toward a giant dripping ball of hot lava slowly cascading down below the horizon, leaving in its wake a picture-perfect purple, red, and black night sky. The Egypt sun was a sun that wanted you to know it was there. That left behind evidence of its majesty.</p>
<p>And me, in my 13 year old stubborn stupor, let that sunset slowly creep into my heart and make a home there. I wasn’t about to admit to <em>anyone</em> that I witnessed pure beauty, despite the fact that they were all there with me.</p>
<p>“You’ll thank us later,” my parents said. How long until later, I wondered? I already felt thankfulness expanding inside of me like what water does when it drips into a sponge. But when exactly would I be have the courage to tell them that they were right?</p>
<p>On the drive home, everyone was exhausted. We all fell asleep in the car, and the last thing I remember thinking, as my face smooshed against the car window, was how beautiful the stars looked from the backseat.</p>
