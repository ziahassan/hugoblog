God it&rsquo;s way too late to be up, yet I am.
Today was Monday, a snowday, and it was a pretty good day all in all. I woke up around 11 or so and had a bagel for breakfast. And jesus, I just realized I haven&rsquo;t gotten out of the house at all.
Then I took David&rsquo;s lyrics and worked the shit out of them. The guy&rsquo;s got such talent… I wanted to write some music to the lyrics that worked and made a tune that did the lyrics justice. So I worked from like… 2-7 on it. Took about 2 hours to get the tracks down and about another 3 to mix the whole thing. The hardest thing was placing the beat in it so that it worked. And getting rid of some lyrics that might&rsquo;ve been important to him. Then I had to add another verse… truly a dual effort. So today&rsquo;s been quite productive, and I feel really good about the recording. He hears it tommorow… will get the verdict then.

<p>I watched Joe Millionaire tonight. It&rsquo;s that show where they tell 20 girls they&rsquo;re going to compete to marry a millionaire (50 mill to be exact)… but it&rsquo;s all a big lie, he makes like 19,000 a year. The chick are SO dumb. But joe&rsquo;s cool, I dig him. Hopefully he won&rsquo;t pick an idiot. There&rsquo;s one think I really dug, but I forgot her name.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t do any homework, but what was I expecting? Hoping for a 2 hr delay tommorow. It&rsquo;s supposed to be icy… let&rsquo;s hope and pray.</p>
