        <p>It&rsquo;s been a fantastic day.</p>
<p>I woke up at like 11 and hung around in my house till 2. I picked Christine up and we went to eat at subway, and then went to White Flint, cuz she had a Borders gift certificate. She was in between a journal, Dante&rsquo;s Inferno, and some other stuff, and ended up just buying a book that is all about trashy movies ðŸ™‚ The guy at the register gave her 10% off. I thought it was neat.</p>
<p>We rented the Breakfast Club, mainly because she had never seen it, and I really wanted to see it again, without the TV edits. She enjoyed it, so I was happy.</p>
<p>But the best thing ever â€“ even though I missed the Vaco show last night, I still got the new CD courtesy of Sami, and it&rsquo;s absolutely amazing. It makes me feel so much better about life right nowâ€¦ and I really needed that. Wish I had seen the show â€“ but this is a great way of making up for that.</p>
<p>And I just had a half hour talk with Utkarsh online.. he&rsquo;s leaving India tommorow. He met Kal Penn, the guy from American Desi who played the ghetto guy, on a train in India. I think that&rsquo;s the coolest thing EVER. Apparnetly he&rsquo;s not ghetto in real life. Damn actors and their ability to convince me that they&rsquo;re the same person in real life. Apparently he&rsquo;s in Van Wilder too. Fuckin cool.</p>
<p>This VaCo cd is making me feel great.</p>
<p>Well I have to practice for Mr. Wootton tommorow at Jeff&rsquo;s house. It&rsquo;s gonna rock, roll, and do all that. But I&rsquo;ll probably be lateâ€¦ too tired to get up at 10:30. Please let the practice go well!</p>
<p>Well now I&rsquo;m gonna get offline and talk to Laura on the phone for a bit, probably fall asleep with my headset on and wake up with a swollen ear. Vaco Rules. SERIOUSLY. Ok, that&rsquo;s all I gotta say.</p>
<p>Apparently in space there are these things called Black Holes. And apparently the connection between two black holes is a worm hole. And if you go inside a wormhole, you&rsquo;ll travel into the future. But of course if you go inside a black hole, you die. So, I guess time travel will never really be proven now will it. However, if we found some way to get a wormhole on earth and maintain that worm holeâ€¦ speed it up to the speed of light, then get another wormhole and speed it up faster, to the destination we wanted to go to, we could techincally create a time machine. I really really want to try that. I want that to be my senior project or something. But, the cool thing is that, we can get to anywhere in the universe within 4 years, if we were to travel at the speed of light. Like if we wanted to travel to the planet Zardoff, we&rsquo;d spend 1 year accelerating to the speed of light, and then another year decellerating. We&rsquo;d end up at the planet, come right home using the same process. Except while we would be 4 years older, earth would be 4.4 million years older. No one would even REMEMBER us, and unless we left some sort of system, some sort of group of people who&rsquo;d be waiting for our arrivalâ€¦ we&rsquo;d get so fucked. It&rsquo;d be like a buncha crazy people who are &ldquo;waiting for God,&rdquo; or something. 4.4 million years though. That is SO long, we could all be dead by then! I&rsquo;m really getting into this time travel stuff. I&rsquo;ll post updates when I learn new stuff. God my cell phone is loud when it is telling me it&rsquo;s out of batteries.</p>
<p>Today. I woke up at 11, and realized I was supposed to be at PJ&rsquo;s to practice for Mr. Wootton. We&rsquo;re doing a cover of Tenacious D song called Wonderboy. Sounded DAMN good today. We finished up around 1 and went to get some food. My ATM card didn&rsquo;t process, so I had to borrow money from Aaron, and I have to pay him back tommorow. Let&rsquo;s see, then what. I went home and my aunt and uncle were here for a bit. They&rsquo;re really cool but I never seem to have anything interesting to say to themâ€¦ so our relationship remains simply at a nephew-uncle/aunt relationsip. Then I hung around for a bit and Christine came over to watch Simpsons. Funny thing though, they started playing a rerun and then realized it was a rerun and skipped into the new one. So we didn&rsquo;t get to see the first 10 mins or so. Then Christine had tons of homework to do, so she went home. And THEN my dad told me I have to take my sister to school tommorow 15 mins early. But it ain&rsquo;t happening. Christine&rsquo;s line was busy so I couldn&rsquo;t get through to tell her. It just isn&rsquo;t fair to do that to her. That, and I REALLY don&rsquo;t want to wake up that early.</p>
<p>I hope my sister does well on her project, she worked REALLY hard on it.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s all I gotta say for now. Just did all my hw. Now I&rsquo;m gonna read more about time travel.</p>
<p>Do you just pretend?</p>
