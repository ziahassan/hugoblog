I’m starting to think that it’s an endless stream hidden by a curtain, and you can bathe in it anytime you want. Hearing your kid cry is hard. So many big emotions, with so few skills in dealing with them. But this is life now. My kid will probably always have a lack of skills to deal with life’s challenges. So will I. If I want to survive the emotional turmoil of being the parent then I have to freeze time. I have to learn how to experience the eternal now. If all time is now, then there’s nothing to miss.
