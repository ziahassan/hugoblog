  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>I&rsquo;ve spent the last 24 hours writing prompts for the Suno AI to produce AI-generated songs, and I&rsquo;m full of fascination and whimsy at what&rsquo;s ahead&hellip;</p>
<p>One simple prompt: &ldquo;Write a song about my son Dezi, who&rsquo;s a superhero; make it sentimental and powerful and something he would like but not kids&rsquo; music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What came out was pure magic: a song that sounded like the AI &ldquo;composer&rdquo; was trained on Rachel Platten&rsquo;s Fight Song. It used his name and talked about how his superpower is his smile (true). I played it for him, and he LOVED it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s singing it?&rdquo; he asked me as we were listening to it again on the way to the school drop-off line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh. There&rsquo;s no real singer. The computer is singing,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the computer has a really nice voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, the song wasn&rsquo;t moving, nor was it particularly engaging or creative—its only notable aspect was that I had provided a prompt that was personal to me and my family.</p>
<p>It dawned on me that this sort of thing will just be part of life for my kids and their peers. Because I remember a world where AI was rather mundane, like a year or two ago, when it could finish your sentences and tell you how to avoid traffic. (Amazing that this feels mundane in 2024)</p>
<p>Just like the pre-pandemic world, that pre-generative AI world feels like a fading dream.</p>
<p>Every generation has its defining moment and, consequently, its fading dream.</p>
<p>For boomers, it was the Vietnam war or maybe the moon landing. For Gen X, perhaps the rise of personal computing. Millenials/Xennials have 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis that hit when a lot of us were new to industry. Gen Z has the rise of mobile phones.</p>
<p>I used to believe that the pandemic was Gen Alpha’s defining moment; it forever altered our way of life, and my children will remain somewhat oblivious to its extent for a while.</p>
<p>After this morning&rsquo;s interaction with my son, I wonder if Gen Alpha&rsquo;s plate-shifting moment is actually the rapid rise of Generative AI and if the pandemic was just a precursor.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it&rsquo;s not so black and white. Perhaps, it&rsquo;s a ricochet, with one development leading to another: personal computing gives rise to mobile technology, which sets the stage for a pandemic era dominated by digital living and a deep yearning for human interaction, only to find ourselves frequently interacting with something that is anything but.</p>
<p>It raises many questions about the future of education. Schools are unique places that house members of many generations in various roles.</p>
<p>How we deal with our fading dreams and burgeoning possibilities is really something to consider.</p>
