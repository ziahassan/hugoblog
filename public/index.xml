      <title>On Being Seen</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some things happen quickly; other things sneak up on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was chatting with a friend recently who used to feel like they were the least valued person in their workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They felt inexperienced, a sense of imposter syndrome, you name it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was just a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But recently, they turned around and looked in the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just a few years, they transitioned from a rookie to training new staff and earning their boss’s deep trust.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In just a few years, they transitioned from a rookie to training new staff and earning their boss’s deep trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s amazing: we hope so deeply to be seen, not realizing that there&amp;rsquo;s a background process going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s what being seen is: a process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s a cumulative one. It starts with the smallest of actions, the smallest of noticings, the smallest of accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accomplishing something small, knowing it may not work but doing it anyway&amp;hellip; these are all skills of the modern worker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do it long enough, and you will be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can&amp;rsquo;t hide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to come out of the shadows, scream your mission statement into the world, and then get after it with as much tenacity as all the people who came before you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Strength of argument vs. Engagement</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/heat/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I know I&amp;rsquo;m going to take some heat for this, but here goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you start your argument with &amp;ldquo;I know I&amp;rsquo;m gonna get some hate for this but&amp;hellip;,&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;re weakening your argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figure people do it because it makes readers click &amp;ldquo;under the fold.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you start your piece in a defensive way, call attention to the fact that your view is unpopular, but at least people read your argument.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So, you start your piece in a defensive way, call attention to the fact that your view is unpopular, but at least people read your argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, those who do agree (shockingly, you end up getting less heat than you proclaimed you would) feel even more validated that their views were expressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things we do to get attention and readership on the internet are really at odds with the principles of good writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least it feels that way, sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning from an intermediate</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/intermediate/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to learn to play basketball, would you rather learn it from the champion of your local high school basketball team, or from Michael Jordan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people, I suspect, would &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; a basketball lesson from Michael Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is misguided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person you want to learn from is the intermediate who has just mastered the part of the skill that you’re about to engage with for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to learn to play basketball, would you rather learn it from the champion of your local high school basketball team, or from Michael Jordan?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people, I suspect, would &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; a basketball lesson from Michael Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is misguided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person you want to learn from is the intermediate who has just mastered the part of the skill that you’re about to engage with for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best teachers know how to break things down. When you’re an expert, and you’ve been doing your craft for decades, the skill becomes so ingrained that it’s &lt;em&gt;harder&lt;/em&gt; to break down than it is for someone who was just in the novice phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want someone who remembers the beats, the steps, the ladder&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want someone who break down the skill technically, and that is most likely someone who is recently familiar with learning the skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alternative is finding someone who has taught the skill for years, because they too have had practice breaking the skill down long after they’ve learned it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’d imagine learning poetry from Bukowski would result in a lot of frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same way that watching a jazz guitar video of Joe Pass makes me want to give up, but a jazz teacher who is a few steps ahead of me makes me feel much more capable.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you actively quiet? Do you shrink back into a corner when we need your voice most?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, are you quietly active? Do you cook up plans in your bedroom without much outward noise, ready to reveal your project when it&amp;rsquo;s finally done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something to be said for being quietly active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It means that you&amp;rsquo;re hard at work, head down, focused on whatever the thing in front of you is./&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to enjoy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me recently that the word &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; kind of sounds like &amp;ldquo;in joy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe that&amp;rsquo;s what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To really enjoy something, you must steep yourself in it. Let it permeate. Simmer. Cook. Bake. Choose your kitchen analogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more time you spend &amp;ldquo;in joy,&amp;rdquo; the more you get the benefits of enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ignore the algorithm</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Almost everything I consume these days comes from an algorithm that I didn&amp;rsquo;t ask for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, I appreciate these algorithms. Spotify and YouTube have introduced me to more good content than I can shake a stick at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a time when I would go into Best Buy (which had a CD section that spanned several rows and had CDs at lower prices than most other places) and buy a CD based on the album art.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Or when I&amp;rsquo;d go into Tower records and put on one of those cool headphones and listen to whatever was being promoted by the staff. Some of my favorite records were discovered this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, I&amp;rsquo;d visit the public library, where all of the albums that people were throwing away/donating would pile up and I&amp;rsquo;d pick up a Lyle Lovett or Guided By Voices album and just bliss out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or I&amp;rsquo;d be in a department store somewhere and trying to hear the lyrics of the song playing on the store speakers, writing them down partially correctly in my notebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the way taste is formed: you stumble across good art. Pushing art on people just because they liked something similar at some point keeps everyone in a box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m far less adventurous these days. Alas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spiritualizing something</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/spiritualizing-something/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My mom used to say that if I didn&amp;rsquo;t assign a religion to my children that they would have no community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now realize this is false; community is simply a combination of common values and unity. You can create this sort of arrangement in many different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A neighborhood, a soccer club, playing bridge, etc&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what&amp;rsquo;s missing is turning something like religion into spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religion may have the ingredients for spirituality, but it does not necessitate it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Religion may have the ingredients for spirituality, but it does not necessitate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t have religion, then my suspicion is that you will crave spirituality in some way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, that came in the form of mysticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for someone else, it could be a destructive habit, such as drugs or alcohol or porn or&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t argue that religion will save us from unhealthy spirituality. But I will argue that it is important for everyone to recognize what unhealthy spirituality feels like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s insidious, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Having a process to process helps you make sense of life</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t build in time to process life events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think [[holidays]] are the ancient way of doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christmas break is often a time to stop and think. New Years resolutions perhaps too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a process to process might mean a weekly/montly moment that isn&amp;rsquo;t tied to a specific event, to sit down and get [[coaching]] or do some [[scoaching]].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sample questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What emotional items need processing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What have I been avoiding?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do I need more of?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do I need less of?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do I need?&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Is it true?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a history of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never been formally diagnosed, but I worry and catastrophize quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard someone once say that a good question to ask in a moment of anxiety is&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is it true?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever it is that you&amp;rsquo;re catastrophizing, whatever belief you&amp;rsquo;re holding that is weighing you down&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it really true?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you know beyond a shadow of a doubt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, the answer to this question is no.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s more like our mind is playing tricks on us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first week of Kindergarten, my son developed benign polyuria, which means you feel the need to pee constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told him it was his brain playing tricks on him, and after a little while, the symptoms went away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many of our symptoms, I wonder, occur because we believe things that are untrue?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>People are just as important as the work in a job</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s something that many of my clients don&amp;rsquo;t realize when they start working with me as a career coach. They think they want a new job. But really, they want a new team and/or a new leader. The best job in the world isn&amp;rsquo;t worth much without the people that go with it. There isn&amp;rsquo;t enough money in the world to make me work on a dysfunctional team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t take long for my clients to figure this out. When I ask them to describe their ideal future job, they talk a little about the work&amp;hellip;and a lot about the people they work with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, you&amp;rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to be on some great teams. Think of your best team, co-worker, or boss. Kind of feels like you could take on any task in the world, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if you&amp;rsquo;re at the final stage of an interview, and everything looks great except the people you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to work with seem burned out, jaded, or siloed? What do you do? Maybe you take the job anyway out of desperation, but you do it begrudgingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the work matters too. But the people are at the heart of it. Very few positions are truly solo. Even entrepreneurs and freelancers need support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time you&amp;rsquo;re in the application process, ask to meet the people who would be your closest colleagues or supervisors. Or, if you aren&amp;rsquo;t at that stage yet, think about what would make a great team so you can use that as a lens when the time comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What kind of vibe do you get? What kind of vibe do you want?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>App-ification or Swiss Army knife for GenAI tools?</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/appfication/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;App-ification&amp;quot; or &amp;ldquo;Swiss Army Knife&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;https://jeppestricker.substack.com/p/how-generative-ai-diminishes-our&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; reminds me of a core idea of mine, one that has been brewing over the course of the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will AI tools become &amp;ldquo;appified?&amp;rdquo; Meaning, will models like GPT and Claude get wrapped into a million little apps that each solve a specific problem? This means that most people won&amp;rsquo;t be concerned with prompts and chats, but will just use apps the way they always have, this time with a layer of Generative AI as a feature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;App-ification&amp;quot; or &amp;ldquo;Swiss Army Knife&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;https://jeppestricker.substack.com/p/how-generative-ai-diminishes-our&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; reminds me of a core idea of mine, one that has been brewing over the course of the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will AI tools become &amp;ldquo;appified?&amp;rdquo; Meaning, will models like GPT and Claude get wrapped into a million little apps that each solve a specific problem? This means that most people won&amp;rsquo;t be concerned with prompts and chats, but will just use apps the way they always have, this time with a layer of Generative AI as a feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This, by the way, is the current state of the EdTech industry, AI tools and all)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will AI tools be more like a swiss army knife? Will we learn to think for ourselves when a problem comes up, the way a developer might write a quick script to scratch their own itch?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an analogy: for years, I have taught people how to use spreadsheets more effectively. Most people know the very basics before they are trained; they don&amp;rsquo;t know enough to solve complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I wanted to lose weight, I could use Excel to track a moving average of my weight, record calories and set up equations, etc&amp;hellip; (swiss army knife model, Excel can do a billion other things)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could download an app like MyFitnessPal or HappyScale (or both). No need to write my own formulas; the app does all of that for me (appified model).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe the world would be better served by the swiss army knife mentality. If an app doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist to solve your problem, you can &amp;ldquo;think&amp;rdquo; your way to a solution, knowing what you know about the all purpose tools such as (Chat)GPT or whatever it may be. We&amp;rsquo;ll all become more nimble thinkers as a result and less reliant on an app store to solve our specific problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m somewhat certain we&amp;rsquo;ll take the appified approach, since it requires the least resistance from our current model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The best way to make the most of [[coaching]]: do what you say you will do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you spend 30 mins with your coach and you have a ton of breakthroughs and realizations and insights&amp;hellip; and then you do &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; with those insights, you&amp;rsquo;re wasting time and money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As coaches, we can help you see more clearly. We can&amp;rsquo;t do it for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The stories we tell ourselves - notes from Inside Out 2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever had a kid’s movie spark a profound realization about careers? That happened to me today while watching Inside Out 2 with my 5-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two main messages of the movie (no heavy spoilers, though maybe light ones) are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our emotions don&amp;rsquo;t get to determine who we are and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What we believe about ourselves affects our choices (and as a corollary, our choices affect our career trajectory).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is tempting to believe that navigating a career journey is just about working hard, growing skills, networking, and achieving important things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is tempting to believe that navigating a career journey is just about working hard, growing skills, networking, and achieving important things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is true, but there&amp;rsquo;s an important, underlying piece to the whole thing&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all starts with our self-concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stories we tell ourselves matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m an impostor who doesn&amp;rsquo;t deserve to be here&amp;rdquo; is a story, just like &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a winner who is smarter than everyone here&amp;rdquo; is a story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Inside Out 2 made me realize is that it&amp;rsquo;s not about just shutting out the bad stories, or even worse, getting mad when you catch yourself telling a negative story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s simply about awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You just ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What story am I telling myself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What actions am I taking (or not taking) as a result?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Making learning relevant is easier said than done</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the hardest things to do as a teacher is make the learning relevant for students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is somewhat easier when I teach a college class than it was when I taught K12, but many students take a class just for credit and aren&amp;rsquo;t really invested in the skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of this reinvention process will be getting students to understand and leverage their strengths effectively. This means letting go of the reigns and letting students decide the ways in which they want to be assessed and how they want to practice their skills.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>We must think deeply about what it means to be an educational institution</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/whatisschoolfor/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to answer the question of what it means to be a university until we answer the question of what it means to be a K12 institution. Maybe the more useful place to start is what it means to be a kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was growing up, K12 was where you learned the &amp;ldquo;basics&amp;rdquo; so that you could &amp;ldquo;figure the rest of it out&amp;rdquo; in college. Even the special classes in high school weren&amp;rsquo;t really that specialized (although I&amp;rsquo;m sure there has been SOME progress in this regard&amp;hellip;.right&amp;hellip;? 😟)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to know what it&amp;rsquo;s like to &amp;ldquo;be human&amp;rdquo; when your day-to-day is obedience, compliance, and &amp;ldquo;high achievement&amp;rdquo; (whatever that means). Much of what K12 is right now goes against the core of what it means to be a kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s time for a more integrative approach earlier on in a person&amp;rsquo;s education. I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about asking them what they want to be when they grow up (a very tired question), or to pick a major in 1st grade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m talking about something much more intentional. A nurturing process. One that can&amp;rsquo;t be outlined in a simple LinkedIn post and might take years or even decades to get right. One that will take many people and ideas to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, a process that is worth thinking deeply about, because it&amp;rsquo;s what will define the future of, well, everything.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In this new era of GenAI, authentic audience will be more important than ever</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How do you turn a standard essay assignment into a platform for real-world skills and broader impact? Last semester, one of my students shocked me with a simple request: to complete their mini-essay as a podcast instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I said yes, the student seemed shocked that I was so easily swayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But truthfully, the way we assess students is going to change rapidly over the coming months and years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many things that are about to change in the world of education. Many of these changes have been needed for a while.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;There are so many things that are about to change in the world of education. Many of these changes have been needed for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that one of those things is the audience that receives student work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until now, that was the teacher. We&amp;rsquo;re paid to care about the student&amp;rsquo;s work and progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we want students want to actually affect change and learn modern skills, we need to expand that audience, and not just when they enter industry or do their first internship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to stop thinking of assessment merely as a way to &amp;ldquo;show what you know.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m honestly tired of assigning and reading the exact same essay or test from every student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we provided more choice than we&amp;rsquo;ve ever provided before? What if we get students to really tap into what&amp;rsquo;s important? What if we explored mediums, such as podcasts and short form video, as a way for students to not only express their knowledge but to inspire and engage audiences outside of the classroom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing is still at the heart of a video, or a podcast, or whatever the end product is. It is still important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the way we use it in school seems completely disconnected from how we use it in industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve felt this way for more than a decade. But up until now, these ideas seemed nice-to-have and very progressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, they seem necessary and urgent.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Get in the GenAI pool, there is no way to drown</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last two keynotes I delivered were to audiences I don&amp;rsquo;t typically present to: PR and marketing professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important takeaways, based on audience feedback, seems to be this&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Generative AI can seem like a really scary thing. I mean, even if you use these technologies, can you even explain how they work? It feels complicated, technical, and for the longest time it was hard to use something like generative AI without also having some knowledge of programming, APIs, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about the problems you&amp;rsquo;d like to solve and then attempting to solve them using a general purpose AI tool (think ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) is the simple, but often ignored process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of folks are waiting for instruction. Waiting to &amp;ldquo;understand it better.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My message to those folks is&amp;hellip; stop waiting. Jump in. The water is perfectly warm and there&amp;rsquo;s no way to drown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not sure where to start, say that in your very first prompt! Converse, iterate, and see what comes up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might just surprise yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mission right now is to get as many people in the water as possible. If we can outsource the tasks we&amp;rsquo;re less interested in to technology, it gives us more freedom and time to do the stuff we &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; doing without tech intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why the job market feels like a dancefloor</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/jobmarketdance/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is a rough job market at the moment. Although the unemployment statistics tell a more rosy story, I work with so many clients who are sending out application after application and rarely getting interviews. Sometimes, this happens even after they&amp;rsquo;ve hired resume writers, coaches, etc. And other career coaches have confirmed they, too, are seeing this pattern with their clients. What was a shorter road a few months ago may be a much longer road now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

What was a shorter road a few months ago may be a much longer road now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons why this is happening, but I&amp;rsquo;ll save that for another post. Today, I just want to re-frame the experience, using a metaphor one of my clients came up with, for anyone who is on the market right now. They made a metaphor for the current job market and compared it to the TV show The Bear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen The Bear, it takes place in a very busy, always-moving restaurant. There are dishes being made, customers being served, and lots of stuff happening all around that not all parties are aware of. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s like a dance,&amp;rdquo; this client said. 💃 Brilliant 🎆&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re out there on the market right now, I encourage you to think of it exactly like this. [[Hunting for a job is like being on the dancefloor]]. There will be people who ghost you. Leads that seem like they&amp;rsquo;re going somewhere until they drop out of existence. Maybe even offers that are later rescinded or even fake/scams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one can tell you how long you&amp;rsquo;ll be on the dance floor. One thing&amp;rsquo;s for sure though: The more time you spend on the floor, the better you become at dancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback is an important ingredient; if you&amp;rsquo;re not getting feedback find ways to seek that out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep on dancing; I&amp;rsquo;m here if you need me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to move from phase 1 to 2 with GenAI</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Going through my LinkedIn feed, you would think the whole world is talking about (and is smarter about) the topics I regularly write and talk about when it comes to AI in education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I can still blow minds when I give keynotes or workshops outside of LinkedIn.
&amp;rsquo;&#39;
I describe &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/byronkingjhb_genai-aied-aieducation-activity-7205105952813989889-nUSZ?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&#34;&gt;Byron King&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;bubble&amp;rdquo; more as a phase 1, where not everyone is up to speed on using GenAI, but the momentum is growing and at some point things till tip. In Phase 2, we will all be able to use GEnAI to get work done in the same way we can all use email for communications (or, the alternative might be something like Excel, which everyone kind of knows how to use but few people really know how to optimize).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;To me, the way we move forward is by getting people to think computationally and understanding the role of delegation (which i have found, humans are notoriously bad at doing, especially if they have competence).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means being curious about how this tech can enhance our lives, and then trying things out. You can&amp;rsquo;t break anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ziahassan.blog/posts/twothings/&#34;&gt;The best way to keep up with tech is to start with a goal and be unafraid to break things&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Two Things That You Need to Keep Up With Tech</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/twothings/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;People sometimes ask me how to &amp;ldquo;keep up&amp;rdquo; with the changing technology. This has become more relevant lately, given the rapid momentum of GenAI, but it seems to be a question many people have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here are the two principles you can use if you want to stay abreast. My one caveat is that there is a tremendous amount of pressure to stay current. I think it will be important for all of us to take stock of how technology is rapidly changing and decide how it will fit into our lives, but I&amp;rsquo;m also against putting pressure on people to &amp;ldquo;keep up.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I think it will be important for all of us to take stock of how technology is rapidly changing and decide how it will fit into our lives, but I&amp;rsquo;m also against putting pressure on people to &amp;ldquo;keep up.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s just a little remnant from my days as a Microsoft consultant, where I saw the negative effect that all of the rapid tech changes (and mountain of tech choices) had on educators. It&amp;rsquo;s only gotten worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here&amp;rsquo;s what I tell people who ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Principle #1: Be curious and start with the goal in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I see a new piece of software, I wonder how it can make my life better or more optimized. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how shiny it is, or how many influencers are using it. If I can&amp;rsquo;t pinpoint an exact need for it in my life, I don&amp;rsquo;t spend my time on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I come up with a potential use case, I&amp;rsquo;ll try out a demo or trial of the product. If it&amp;rsquo;s too convoluted or I spend more than an appropriate amount of time on it before it starts to show promise, I&amp;rsquo;ll move on. This is most apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process eventually yields a small number of life-changing apps (Omnifocus, Readwise, and Obsidian, to name a few). It ends up worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Principle #2: You can&amp;rsquo;t break anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People always tell me &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m afraid I&amp;rsquo;ll mess something up. I&amp;rsquo;m so tech-illiterate!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With most of the apps you&amp;rsquo;ll use these days, you &lt;em&gt;can&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; mess anything up. There is always an undo feature, a rollback, or a way to recover your work. It&amp;rsquo;s not like the old days when if your hard drive crashed, you were left without any option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, push tech to its limits. Start with the end in mind. Find ways to optimize so that you have the mental and creative energy to change the world.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rediscovering Human Creativity in the Age of AI</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a framework to keep you balanced in this generative AI age. I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you, but I&amp;rsquo;m finding myself yearning to rediscover the joy in what makes creativity uniquely human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what I came up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, rid yourself of any social pressures you feel to &amp;ldquo;keep up&amp;rdquo; or that your creative job is somehow going to be taken by an AI. It&amp;rsquo;s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, break up your creative process into separate pieces. Whatever that means for you. Maybe your process is a series of steps, such as idea generation, discernment, evaluating, testing, iterating&amp;hellip; whatever that may be for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which part(s) of the process light me up?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which part(s) of the process, if eliminated, would let me do more of #1?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you hate revising for structure, so that&amp;rsquo;s the part where you integrate some AI, such as Grammarly, ChatGPT or Claude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe you actually &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; idea generation. You keep a notebook on you at all times to write down interesting things you notice so you can incorporate these things into your creative work later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, AI is not appropriate for that part of the creative process. That part is functionally satisfying for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And despite the fact that you could, if you wanted to, tell ChatGPT to give you 10 ideas for a dark rom-com set in 1970s LA, you&amp;rsquo;d rather experience the fun of that reflective and dynamic eureka moment when you come up with a world-changing idea using &lt;em&gt;nothing but your wetware.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, your office mate &lt;em&gt;dreads&lt;/em&gt; facing the blank page. For them, Generative AI is an unlock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relying on AI for all the parts of the process might produce emotionally cold results. A TV script that &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;/em&gt; like Aaron Sorkin is novel and impressive, but an actual Aaron Sorkin script is the one that will bring a viewer to tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s one way to operate. Humanize the parts of the process you love and outsource the parts you don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Be a scientist about your medical mysteries</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/scientificicmedical/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Something interesting to consider is that being a scientist about your medical data is probably a more efficient route than waiting for a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not suggesting skipping the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the doctor can&amp;rsquo;t really see what you&amp;rsquo;re doing when you&amp;rsquo;re not in their office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can&amp;rsquo;t keep tabs on your habits, your posture, your meals, your fitness, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;rsquo;t know about how you reached into your backseat for something, and then forgot about it later when you complained about your shoulder pain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Better idea: rather than waiting for a diagnosis, we become &lt;em&gt;proactive&lt;/em&gt; in our health mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We keep rigorous data around our ailments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ask AI to analyze those and look for patterns (without asking for a diagnosis).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick is to making sure that AI or Google doesn&amp;rsquo;t give you false diagnoses; the idea is simply to look for patterns and then report these back to your primary care after having AI analyze the patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They could use this to help with their work, and they&amp;rsquo;ll probably thank you as long as you didn&amp;rsquo;t add a bunch of extra AI-induced hallucinations somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What happens when your system of [[thinking]] becomes personalized?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about what [[critical thinking]] really means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll find many definitions on Google. Most definitions make it sound like critical thinking means using your rational judgment, putting emotion aside, and solving a problem of some kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with this, but I believe we need to think (critically) about what this looks like in classrooms in the age of generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll find many definitions on Google. Most definitions make it sound like critical thinking means using your rational judgment, putting emotion aside, and solving a problem of some kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with this, but I believe we need to think (critically) about what this looks like in classrooms in the age of generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the best definition I could come up with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critical thinking is&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Using some system of thinking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to arrive at an alignment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of values and action&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then doing the damn thing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key here is the &amp;ldquo;system of thinking&amp;rdquo; part of the equation. [[Edward DeBono]] argued decades ago that our mental operating systems are outdated and that we&amp;rsquo;ve essentially been using the same mental operating systems since the Renaissance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of thinking has historically been presented as a vertical thing. I remember my first grade teacher describing learning and thinking like &amp;ldquo;putting bricks down to build a building.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a personalized system of thinking breaks this paradigm. You could choose to build your knowledge in a linear fashion, or it could be that you collect various pieces of info, like index cards on a corkboard, only to make sense of them later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might then turn to an [[AI]] to make sense of the pieces, and then run the result through my human thinking filter to reflect and refine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way that we do our thinking is going to change considerably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the way we teach must also change. This is our work for the next several/many years.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Our gatekeeping problem with AI</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve now seen a few posts where people who position themselves as AI experts ridicule their audience by telling them that if they use the term &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo; to describe an LLM (such as ChatGPT) that they will sound &amp;ldquo;foolish&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;silly.&amp;rdquo; While it is true that using terms like LLM or Generative to describe different kinds of AI tools is more specific in some contexts, it does NOT make you sound foolish to call something like ChatGPT an AI. It is an AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve now seen a few posts where people who position themselves as AI experts ridicule their audience by telling them that if they use the term &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo; to describe an LLM (such as ChatGPT) that they will sound &amp;ldquo;foolish&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;silly.&amp;rdquo; While it is true that using terms like LLM or Generative to describe different kinds of AI tools is more specific in some contexts, it does NOT make you sound foolish to call something like ChatGPT an AI. It is an AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also AI tools that folks have used for years, but just never called them an AI. When your phone predicts the next word in your sentence, it may not &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; the same way as it feels to type a prompt into ChatGPT&amp;hellip; but it is still considered AI. Or when Waze uses predictive AI to tell you the best route to avoid traffic&amp;hellip; it feels like it&amp;rsquo;s just &amp;ldquo;tech,&amp;rdquo; but really, it&amp;rsquo;s quite amazing considering that I used to scotch tape Mapquest directions on my dashboard when I&amp;rsquo;d drive somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people post these degrading comments to people who are new to the AI world, it strikes a nerve. My favorite people to train are the frightened beginners. People often tell me that I helped them reduce their anxiety around using these tools. Most of the enthusiasts I meet, myself included, believe we will soon live in a world where everyone knows how to use generative AI and other AI tools to enhance their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter what they want to call it. I&amp;rsquo;ve never heard anyone call their Maps app a &amp;ldquo;predictive AI tool.&amp;rdquo; No one cares. What matters is that it got you to work on time. In the end, all of it breaks down into algorithms. The more accessible we make it, the better.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the years that I&amp;rsquo;ve been teaching college classes, there&amp;rsquo;s a disturbing trend which I assume was picked up in grade school: the students believe that good note-taking involves writing down as much as they can of what the professor says during the lecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This misunderstanding of how to take good notes results in a lot of push-back over my technology policy (which is to be as tech free as possible).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But I type faster than I write!&amp;rdquo; the students argue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be technically true, but a little bit of friction tends to go a long way. When I have to stop and write stuff down by hand, I write fewer things (and therefore become more selective about what I capture) and I put myself in a position where I need to think about my learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typing up a page of notes might mean that I never look at it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, don&amp;rsquo;t write down what the teacher says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, engage in learning and write down only what needs to be taken away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also the famous &amp;ldquo;work life&amp;rdquo; balance, as if life is not part work, and work is not part of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you seek direction, betterment, peace, tranquality, whatever it is you&amp;rsquo;re here for&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind this important fact: it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; life.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Advice could be holding you back</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/adviceholdingyouback/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you like advice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If so, you&amp;rsquo;re not alone. Many people on the LinkedIn platform are here for career advancement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are not only many people giving advice, but there are also many people who lack a sense of direction and are looking for advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it&amp;rsquo;s common to see a lot of advice here about what you should be doing and what you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t get a job as a (fill in the blank)!&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t pursue (some degree)!&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;You should always &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Never do this&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Do you like advice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If so, you&amp;rsquo;re not alone. Many people on the LinkedIn platform are here for career advancement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are not only many people giving advice, but there are also many people who lack a sense of direction and are looking for advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it&amp;rsquo;s common to see a lot of advice here about what you should be doing and what you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t get a job as a (fill in the blank)!&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t pursue (some degree)!&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;You should always &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Never do this&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially if you are directionless or searching for new career options, it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to get caught up in all the advice. Especially if you read people&amp;rsquo;s comments that usually say &amp;ldquo;thank you, great advice&amp;rdquo; which is the stock response on LinkedIn posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as a corollary, it is easy to forget that YOU have your own internal navigation system, just like the people giving advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a coach who helps people navigate their career journeys, I have many clients who complain about all the conflicting advice they see on LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of it is phrased strongly to draw attention to profiles of creators. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever attended any sort of marketing course or workshop, you&amp;rsquo;ve been told that you need to have super strong opinions or else no one will read your content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand the logic behind this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you are a person who is trying to navigate your career journey, listening to what everyone tells you on LinkedIn may be counterintuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, instead of advice, I&amp;rsquo;m going to end this post with some questions for self-reflecton:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forget all the &amp;ldquo;shoulds&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;ts&amp;rdquo; - what do YOU really want?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s one actionable step, even if it&amp;rsquo;s imperfect, you could take today to move toward the life you want?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s in your way?&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is easy to feel behind in your career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like everyone else is surpassing you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all the dreams you had a few years ago are still unrealized, and that other people are filling in those gaps that you wanted to fill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever had a huge dream, sat on it for a few years and got distracted with meaningless busy work, you know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to overcoming this is realizing the power of incremental progress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The key to overcoming this is realizing the power of incremental progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got this idea from David Allen&amp;rsquo;s amazing book Getting Things Done years ago: you can&amp;rsquo;t really do a project. However, you can do the steps needed to finish a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I can&amp;rsquo;t write my dissertation tomorrow, but can I read 5 pages on my research topic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I can&amp;rsquo;t immediately get a job as an instructional designer. But can I follow 5 people who do that job to learn what their lives are like, and what they&amp;rsquo;re thinking about on a day to day basis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I can&amp;rsquo;t build a house by the end of the week. But can I lay the first brick?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on the next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s yours?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I totally messed up</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I totally messed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again and again over the course of my career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was the time I wrote and played an original song for someone&amp;rsquo;s birthday on my ukulele, at a staff meeting in my early 20&amp;rsquo;s, in the presence of a very bewildered client, who later complained to my manager. I was one week in to the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time I accidentally let baby tarantulas loose in my student teaching classroom, when I was supposed to be in charge. I was sent home early that day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The time I accidentally let baby tarantulas loose in my student teaching classroom, when I was supposed to be in charge. I was sent home early that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time I made a seemingly harmless joke during a training that turned out to be a really sensitive subject for the client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time I thought &amp;ldquo;TR&amp;rdquo; meant Thursday and didn&amp;rsquo;t come to the first day of a college class I was teaching. (Hint: T means Tuesday, R means Thursday)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time I didn&amp;rsquo;t handle myself well during a critique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the times I missed my deadline, said the wrong thing, lost business, or just generally screwed something up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go on&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve got a long list of these moments, and they sometimes replay in my head without my consent. I cringe every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I could go back and do it all again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be nice to have a clean record. No big mistakes. Just good, hard work. Professional disposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then again&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bet you&amp;rsquo;ve got a list of these moments, too. We all do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would life be like in the work world without people messing up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There would be no lessons learned. No growth. No curiosity. No reflection. No humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I work with an AI and it hallucinates or doesn&amp;rsquo;t do what I want, it apologizes profusely and then later makes that same mistake again. Maybe it will &amp;ldquo;update its memory,&amp;rdquo; and remember that I didn&amp;rsquo;t like whatever the output was. But it&amp;rsquo;s largely indifferent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But me? I&amp;rsquo;m a human with rich, lived experiences. Lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learned with my entire body. Emotions that are embedded &lt;em&gt;deep in my bones&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This system of learning can never be replicated by a machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is beauty in our typos, love in our failures, and joy when we fall flat on our face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s us being fully and completely human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humanity is our increasingly valuable gift to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what are YOUR biggest mess-ups, failures, face plants, etc? Let&amp;rsquo;s celebrate together 🥳&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AI is not good at information retrieval</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/aiinforetrieval/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of people who are new or less experienced with GenAI complain about the way it makes stuff up (known as hallucination). Sometimes this comes down to a misunderstanding of how these systems work with information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of our internet-enabled life, we&amp;rsquo;ve used search engines that look for matching text and keywords on pre-existing webpages. In other words, we&amp;rsquo;ve used it for information retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GenAI can be quite unreliable in certain situations. For instance, I once asked it for the current date, and it repeatedly provided the incorrect date, even after I pointed out the error. I mean, even the most ancient Candybar Nokia phone can sync to a satellite to tell me what time it is. How is that this supposedly life-changing technology can&amp;rsquo;t even tell me what day it is?!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

How is that this supposedly life-changing technology can&amp;rsquo;t even tell me what day it is?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason is that these models are generative, meaning they produce text, images, etc on the fly, after being &amp;ldquo;trained&amp;rdquo; on many many documents and texts. It isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;looking things up.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s using its pattern recognition algorithms to generate new text (or pictures or music or whatever).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While LLMs are pretty magical, information retrieval just isn&amp;rsquo;t a strong suit in many cases. That&amp;rsquo;s not to say it never works; I&amp;rsquo;ve had success learning about certain topics with an LLM. It&amp;rsquo;s just not as reliable as say, Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: it now gives me the right date and time if I ask it, but not before &amp;ldquo;analyzing&amp;rdquo; which involves communicating with some external source to determine the time. Here&amp;rsquo;s how GPT describes it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When I perform tasks like checking the current time, I use a combination of my generative capabilities and external tools or databases to ensure accuracy. In this case, I used a Python script to get the precise current time, rather than generating a response based solely on my training data. This ensures that the information is accurate and up-to-date.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, it does what you could do by looking at your phone and checking the time. This is important when you consider when and how to use these sorts of tools.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>All Science Starts with Intuition</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After all, what is a hypothesis if it isn&amp;rsquo;t trying to prove an intuitive nudge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My third-grade teacher would have me believe that is a hypothesis is basically an &amp;ldquo;educated guess,&amp;rdquo; which is a good explanation for a third grader&amp;hellip; but I&amp;rsquo;m starting to realize it&amp;rsquo;s more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the science is the afterthought, a result that is enabled by an intuitive &lt;em&gt;nudge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the Buddha, who clearly believed in the healing benefits of meditation long before the science caught up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;He intuitively felt that the practice of meditating was &lt;em&gt;so worthwhile&lt;/em&gt; that it spurred an entire religion and way of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever a scientist wants to discover something, the path to this discovery doesn&amp;rsquo;t come out of thin air—it comes out of the scientist&amp;rsquo;s interest, worldview, and internal sense of knowing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to get to know someone better</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are three steps if you want to truly be in someone&amp;rsquo;s corner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Become endlessly curious about their lives. Don&amp;rsquo;t tell them why you like their work; ask them what makes it important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See their flaws as human; believe in their full potential. This makes you less critical and judgy. It helps you see everyone as incredible human beings who sometimes get in their own way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell them the truth. With love.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Student Engagement in a Post AI world</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/studentengagementai/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the many ways in which our world will change as a result of generative AI will be the way in which students engage with school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in the last few years, things have changed regarding engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pandemic brought about extremely lax policies with phones, for example. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it in middle/high school classrooms when I coach teachers, and it&amp;rsquo;s very hard (or annoying) to enforce policies around phone use when no one else is, and having your phone out in school (and sometimes your earbuds) is just a ubiquitous part of student life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The difference is that a couple of years ago, if you didn&amp;rsquo;t pay attention in class, it would be hard to do a project, or write an essay, or pass a quiz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now? Most exams can be gamed unless you have extremely tight supervision (somewhat unrealistic in a world of asynchronous and hybrid courses).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most student essays (like your typical 5 paragraph literary analysis on Romeo and Juliet) can be generated by a large language model. With some iterative prompting and other tricks (which students are already getting good at), it may not even sound like stock AI text anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, these essays are not &amp;ldquo;good.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve generated a bunch just to experiment. They&amp;rsquo;re boring and lack any sort of style or character, and when you try to apply a particular &amp;ldquo;style&amp;rdquo; using prompting it can get even more ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. These assignments, historically, aren&amp;rsquo;t about style. They aren&amp;rsquo;t supposed be interesting. They&amp;rsquo;re about &amp;ldquo;showing what you know.&amp;rdquo; Easily gameable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And honestly, who could blame these students?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know if I was a high schooler, and I understood how to use generative AI better than my teachers&amp;hellip; I would game the system, too. As it is, I barely read the assigned books in high school. Believe me, I wanted to, they sure seemed interesting&amp;hellip; but, the adolescent brain doesn&amp;rsquo;t plan very well, so I read the bare minimum that I would need to pass my classes (which it turns out, wasn&amp;rsquo;t very much).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I&amp;rsquo;m not alone in this. Back then, it was quite costly to get a &amp;ldquo;cheat code&amp;rdquo; like Cliff&amp;rsquo;s notes. You had to really scour the web for something or you had to go buy a physical copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried to cheat on a literary essay in over 20 years, but I imagine it&amp;rsquo;s infinitely easier now, generative AI aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, we now have a bunch of folks, including myself, who are thinking about the future of not only assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other side of the coin is student engagement. The way our classrooms looked yesterday (and the way teachers are assessed) will be very different in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creativity: Product or Person or when?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to creativity, we can either assess the person creating or the creation itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might make more sense to judge the creation when the creator does not need formative feedback in the same way that a student would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I probably won&amp;rsquo;t critique Thom Yorke if I don&amp;rsquo;t like a Radiohead album. There&amp;rsquo;s not much utility in that. But I will critique the album, so others can know whether or not to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But when assessing someone like a student, it makes a whole lot more sense to assess them as a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are their creative habits? How do they get out of their own way to ideate? How do they keep their analytical inner critique at bay until the right moment?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was nineteen, I invited some of my friends from high school over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon enough, we began talking politics. We were, after all, newly minted college students. Only recently did any of us really read a newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time (over 20 years ago), gay marriage was still illegal. We were all discussing it until one friend said &amp;ldquo;but none of us are gay. Why are we even talking about this?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It was a thought that, still in our adolescence, was worth thinking about at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later, I came across this quote from a parenting podcast called Zen Parenting Radio:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Can we hold space for someone else&amp;rsquo;s experience?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It occurs to me now that this may be the entire basis of a healthy relationship. I hold just enough space for your experiences if you hold just enough for mine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Small Talk on Social Media</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always been interested (and somewhat put off) by the viral trend (mostly on short form content networks) of people doing things like cooking, getting ready, etc and spouting their views about all sorts of things that aren&amp;rsquo;t very interesting or profound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we watch this garbage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the truth is: we want to simulate social connection. We often have talks with people while playing video games, getting ready to go out, cooking, etc. The conversation is mostly unrelated to whatever we&amp;rsquo;re doing (which kind of reminds me of why some men&amp;rsquo;s groups work on cars while talking about their home lives).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The people that make these sorts of videos are rarely trained or educated on the topic. It&amp;rsquo;s like having some deep conversation with your wacky aunt or uncle at a party that you forget about minutes later. Small talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth is, so much of these platforms are for that exact purpose: a simulacrum of small talk to fill some kind of social void left by, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, covid? or is this just a symptom and craving that comes with adult life?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The First Phase of the GenAI revolution</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this first phase of the generative AI revolution, we&amp;rsquo;re all learning how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even those that call themselves experts are just poking around, figuring out what works and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, we&amp;rsquo;ll get past this phase. The majority of us will know the basis of how to interact with a model like GPT or Claude, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does life look like then? We&amp;rsquo;re so fascinated right now that we aren&amp;rsquo;t thinking about the impact.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;What does life look like then? We&amp;rsquo;re so fascinated right now that we aren&amp;rsquo;t thinking about the impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question I seek to answer over the next few years as a researcher is what education, training, and coaching look like after we&amp;rsquo;ve all adopted generative AI (to some degree) in our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the second phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m super interested in the second phase right now. Much more than I am fascinated by this first phase (and believe me, I&amp;rsquo;m thoroughly fascinated by this first phase).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second phase, the majority of teachers generate customized and targeted lesson plans for their students. Cool. Maybe AI will get good enough to grade assignments reliably. Cool. Students will find ways to outsource their work to GPT if they are motivated to do so. Cool cool cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A student asked me the other day: &amp;ldquo;what happens when we&amp;rsquo;re completing all of our work using AI and you&amp;rsquo;re grading it using AI? Where does that leave us?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is&amp;hellip; this may seem like it&amp;rsquo;s a world that&amp;rsquo;s far away at the moment, and only the most technologically adaptive teachers are doing this kind of thing right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Phase 2 is closer than you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year ago, I could not find anyone else that truly saw what I saw, and understood the impact models like ChatGPT would have on education and the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it&amp;rsquo;s a lot more common to find people that get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tech will become ubiquitous in phase 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to think about what student engagement, assessment, and creativity look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to reimagine the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must experiment responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AI can create, but it can&#39;t be creative</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I can get generative AI to write a sonnet in the voice of Brene Brown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it won’t have any &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003233930-12/creative-articulation-jonathan-plucker&#34;&gt;social or cultural context&lt;/a&gt; for this outside of its training on human-written text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can get to write a screenplay that sounds like Aaron Sorkin. But it will move no one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or I can get it to write a song that sounds like Taylor Swift, but it won’t wrench my heart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Gen Alpha and AI</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last 24 hours writing prompts for the Suno AI to produce AI-generated songs, and I&amp;rsquo;m full of fascination and whimsy at what&amp;rsquo;s ahead&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One simple prompt: &amp;ldquo;Write a song about my son Dezi, who&amp;rsquo;s a superhero; make it sentimental and powerful and something he would like but not kids&amp;rsquo; music.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What came out was pure magic: a song that sounded like the AI &amp;ldquo;composer&amp;rdquo; was trained on Rachel Platten&amp;rsquo;s Fight Song. It used his name and talked about how his superpower is his smile (true). I played it for him, and he LOVED it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who&amp;rsquo;s singing it?&amp;rdquo; he asked me as we were listening to it again on the way to the school drop-off line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Uh. There&amp;rsquo;s no real singer. The computer is singing,&amp;rdquo; I replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well, the computer has a really nice voice.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, the song wasn&amp;rsquo;t moving, nor was it particularly engaging or creative—its only notable aspect was that I had provided a prompt that was personal to me and my family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It dawned on me that this sort of thing will just be part of life for my kids and their peers. Because I remember a world where AI was rather mundane, like a year or two ago, when it could finish your sentences and tell you how to avoid traffic. (Amazing that this feels mundane in 2024)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like the pre-pandemic world, that pre-generative AI world feels like a fading dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every generation has its defining moment and, consequently, its fading dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For boomers, it was the Vietnam war or maybe the moon landing. For Gen X, perhaps the rise of personal computing. Millenials/Xennials have 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis that hit when a lot of us were new to industry. Gen Z has the rise of mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to believe that the pandemic was Gen Alpha’s defining moment; it forever altered our way of life, and my children will remain somewhat oblivious to its extent for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this morning&amp;rsquo;s interaction with my son, I wonder if Gen Alpha&amp;rsquo;s plate-shifting moment is actually the rapid rise of Generative AI and if the pandemic was just a precursor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s not so black and white. Perhaps, it&amp;rsquo;s a ricochet, with one development leading to another: personal computing gives rise to mobile technology, which sets the stage for a pandemic era dominated by digital living and a deep yearning for human interaction, only to find ourselves frequently interacting with something that is anything but.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It raises many questions about the future of education. Schools are unique places that house members of many generations in various roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How we deal with our fading dreams and burgeoning possibilities is really something to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Radar Tag</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2024-03-04-the-radar-tag/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my task management system, I employ tags to keep things organized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common ones are my tags that relate to energy. This allows me to filter my tasks depending on what kind of energy I&amp;rsquo;m currently experiencing. Am I braindead after a long day of work? Or, am I in seriouscoffeedeepwork mode? Or something in between like adminrespondtoemail mode?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also tend to use a category of tags around roles. Am I looking for tasks that relate to being a parent? Or perhaps tasks that are related to being a solopreneuer?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I also tend to use a category of tags around roles. Am I looking for tasks that relate to being a parent? Or perhaps tasks that are related to being a solopreneuer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important tags in the system, however, is the radar tag. This goes beyond a simple priority star, or a signifying letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tag goes on tasks that aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily due tomorrow (I use date dates for that) and they aren&amp;rsquo;t even necessarily high priority tasks (I use a Today tag or a star for that). Instead, these are tasks that I want to be aware of every single week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my weekly review, one of the steps is to filter my task system for the radar tasks and simply look at them and figure out when I&amp;rsquo;m going to start them. Or, at the very least, look at them and freak out about the looming deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The radar tag fits a category of task that would sometimes go under the radar for too long, and by the time the task surfaced in my giant ocean of tasks, it felt overwhelming to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to get projects done, in my opinion, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; those with far off due dates, is to get tiny pieces done in advance. The radar tag is one tool I use to do exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Career coaching is life coaching</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to tell potential clients that I&amp;rsquo;m a life coach who specializes in careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t say that anymore. It tends to confuse people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, it&amp;rsquo;s still true. If you ever work with a career coach who doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand life coaching, you&amp;rsquo;re wasting your time and money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every job, every pivot, and every bullet on your resume is a little slice of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each element of your job search needs reflection, feedback, and iteraton.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Each element of your job search needs reflection, feedback, and iteraton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There just isn&amp;rsquo;t any way around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not the job application process that hinders people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the hesitation, the second-guessing, the self-doubt, the sabotaging thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a lack of momentum and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with hiring a resume writer or a career counselor. They&amp;rsquo;ll tell you exactly what &lt;em&gt;they think&lt;/em&gt; you should do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ultimately, this structure falls apart. They aren&amp;rsquo;t you. They don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily share your values, your worldview, and your life goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important gift a career coach can give their client?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to be yourself</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We often think that it&amp;rsquo;s virtuous to be a &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; person. But the way in which we are good changes given the circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we really are is weird, flawed, and full of human-ness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s better this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to really get good at their craft, improvisers drop the awareness that the audience is watching and judging. They &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to. The quality of their improv depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s mind blowing how hard it is to accept this. It&amp;rsquo;s so challenging that I even developed a mantra that I often recite to myself when my mind starts cycling through embarrassing and cringy memories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am allowed to make mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can make multiple mistakes per day, and I am still worthy of love and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can make my life a practice of making errors, blunders, and left turns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I can grow alongside the rest of the people in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a little typing test for the corne keyboard. I am indeed becoming more proficient with it. It feels like I do have to move around a bit less and I can now see why people 12&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How many daily tasks do you perform without thinking because they have always been done that way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you work a job that you hate, what steps are you taking to &lt;em&gt;change your daily habits&lt;/em&gt; so that you can become a new person, the type of person who has a fulfilling and joyful career?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people spend time scrolling the web, looking for leads on some job where they meet 100% of the requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Most people spend time scrolling the web, looking for leads on some job where they meet 100% of the requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newsflash: if you are looking for a job you are 100% qualified for, your move is &lt;em&gt;lateral&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;upward&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some ways to break your patterns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend a day noticing what draws your attention. Are you walking on the street, noticing different billboards? What is it about these billboards that are drawing you in?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What books are you reading right now? Are they shifting your thinking, or are they for comfort? There is &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; wrong with comfort reading. But consider adding some material that will stretch your mind. What have you always wanted to learn? There are likely thousands of books, YouTube channels, or podcasts on the topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take action. Make that meeting. Call that contact. Message that person on LinkedIn. The worst that happens is nothing. The best that happens? I don&amp;rsquo;t know; it&amp;rsquo;s variable. But aren&amp;rsquo;t you curious to find out?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take these thoughts into your weekend and the following week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From the moment my third grader (or was it fifth? I had the same teacher for both) read this book to me, my life completely changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s the first 3 or so chapters, which set up the rest of the book so beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way in which stars are characterized, are personalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way that the generic theme of love vs. evil is told through the lens of the expansive realms of time and space.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Analog vs. Digital tools</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/analogvsdigital/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking deeply about the way in which I use digital and analog tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having recently picked up the Kindle Scribe, I&amp;rsquo;ve become interested (again) in the power of handwriting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One core realization of the digital/analog divide seems to be that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital tools are useful for efficiency;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analog tools (notebooks, pens, etc) are useful for thinking and focus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a tool like Obsidian is useful in that it allows me to really plan my year, my quarterly goals, etc. It allows me to write documents efficiently with markdown. And for things I will either need again, or that I would like to resurface at some point, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing like it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A tool like Ominfocus is great at being the &amp;ldquo;bank&amp;rdquo; as David Sparks calls it. I will not lose track of &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; if it is store in Omnifocus&amp;hellip; AND the perspectives I can create are endless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t query a notebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for daily plans, weekly spreads, future logs, collections, etc. I&amp;rsquo;m starting to think that something like the Bullet Journal may be the best way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, the Bullet Journal and something like Obsidian (and perhaps a robust task manager such as Omnifocus or Todoist or Things3) could bring order to chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your eyes are on the snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want your eyes to look where you want to go, not at what you want to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-board-games-condition-us&#34;&gt;How Board Games Condition Us&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I distinctly remember playing board games with my mom, dad, and sister when I was growing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We kept them in this tiny, narrow crevice under my bunkbed, which usually meant we&amp;rsquo;d play the games in my bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We played Monopoly, The Game of Life, Connect 4, and various other TV-themed games that I don&amp;rsquo;t recall now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We kept a number of these same games in whatever elementary or middle school classrooms I was a part of, too. They were the go-to activities when the teacher hadn&amp;rsquo;t planned anything or when we needed to stay indoors for recess due to the weather.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;May be an image of text that says &amp;lsquo;The older gens that are like, &amp;ldquo;You can&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; have anxiety and depression,&amp;rdquo; are the same ones that gave us a game called Perfection in which, if you weren&amp;rsquo;t perfect in a limited amount of of time, the board literally blew up in your face PERFECT 0 X&amp;rsquo;&#34; src=&#34;media/May_be_an_image_of_text_that_says_&#39;The_older_gens_that_are_like,_!You_can&#39;t_!all!_have_anxiety_and_d.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny. But it also got me thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use games of all kinds to teach skills. Therapists use different categories of games to help their patients, depending on their goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s what I started to wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What lessons did we learn from board games when we were children?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What other contradictions exist between what adults espoused when we were most impressionable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;games-and-their-inherent-perspectives&#34;&gt;Games and their Inherent Perspectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games come with their inherent perspective on life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, perhaps Uno teaches us that noticing similarities among our peers is positive. In Uno, the person who has the most in common with other players wins (because they can play matching cards and run out, which is the goal of Uno).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, this could be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or how about Operation? If you even graze the sides of the little crevice, you&amp;rsquo;ll get the loudest and most obnoxious negative response you could think of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, you can&amp;rsquo;t make a mistake as a doctor doing heart surgery, but what about as a kid trying to pen an essay or solve a math problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taboo taught us how to communicate without being direct. As a result, we leave out the most important and relevant words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever had a passive conversation with someone where you wanted to be direct but felt the urge to run and hide? It&amp;rsquo;s psychologically typical, but in Taboo, we &lt;em&gt;honed&lt;/em&gt; this skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Taboo also got us thinking creatively about how to express our thoughts. It brought us closer to our friends and family since we needed to rely on inside jokes and shared experiences. A positive way to look at the Taboo perspective is that words don&amp;rsquo;t tie us together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or how about The Game of Life? You spin a wheel and move up the hierarchy of life. But the perspective of this game is that the most traditional route wins. Get married, get a job, have kids, own the most expensive and luxurious property you can afford&amp;hellip; and you win at life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perspective here is that there&amp;rsquo;s one way to win life. And we played this &lt;em&gt;as freakin&amp;rsquo; children.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cranium taught us that being a generalist could be valuable. It&amp;rsquo;s cool to know simple trivia or to be able to build clay figures or to be able to know what song someone is humming. But if you can do all three, you&amp;rsquo;re a winner in Cranium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only game I could think of that felt true to life was Chutes and Ladders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire game is pure luck. Some people fall, some ascend, and no one __ knows who&amp;rsquo;s winning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-games-intentionally&#34;&gt;Using Games Intentionally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My aversion to board games these days is that people get overly competitive. Perhaps my highly sensitive nature keeps me from really getting engaged and being comfortable with friendly competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or it&amp;rsquo;s losing so many games to my older cousins when I was a kid (and then getting teased for constantly losing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing about playing games as a youngster is that you rarely have control over what games are available. Whatever is in your teacher&amp;rsquo;s closet, or whatever your parents have brought with them from their early 20s, is all you&amp;rsquo;ve got for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you play those games and get habituated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if we took matters into our own hands and picked games that helped us address our deficits?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapists do precisely this. And they use four different categories of games to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;communication-games&#34;&gt;Communication Games&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are low competition, high collaboration, and high self-expression games. They provide a safe atmosphere for the players. Think of icebreakers at your work orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;problem-solving-games&#34;&gt;Problem-solving Games&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are competitive games with definitive rules. These games challenge players to perform. Think about any athletic sport; most board games (especially those mentioned above) fall into this category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ego-enhancing-games&#34;&gt;Ego-enhancing Games&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These promote competition, challenge, and skill&amp;hellip; but also have a component of self-image. These allow a player to have impulse control and develop frustration tolerance. It makes me think about video games, like Celeste, where you fail often. To win, you have to get over that fact and keep grinding. A player could start seeing their world this way; it&amp;rsquo;s an endless grind, but it&amp;rsquo;s worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;socialization-games&#34;&gt;Socialization Games&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are games that, as you may have already guessed, improve interpersonal thinking/interactions. It reminds me of that scene in Monty Python&amp;rsquo;s Meaning of Life, where people sit down at a restaurant and order a &amp;ldquo;conversation&amp;rdquo; after being shown a menu of topics. Many modern games use this concept, using cards/topics as a starting point for getting to know someone better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;choose-your-game&#34;&gt;Choose Your Game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take from this the belief that you have a choice in the types of games you play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren&amp;rsquo;t just transient, meaningless ways of wasting our time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re a form of practice. A rehearsal for life, just as fiction movies/books tend to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what game do you &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to play for personal growth?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Just Be Weird</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve had trouble with conforming to society’s expectations for my entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When everyone in art class drew a picture in elementary school, I wrote a poem (in a cool font, I might add).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When everyone learned Dave Matthews covers in high school, I was writing my own music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When everyone else decided to use a Mac or a PC in college, I used a text-based Linux machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was asked to play happy birthday for a colleague at work, I composed a birthday song for the person on my ukulele. And performed it in a breakout room. In front of clients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;When I was asked to play happy birthday for a colleague at work, I composed a birthday song for the person on my ukulele. And performed it in a breakout room. In front of clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My boss said, “maybe you should keep your personality out of the office.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was that day that I vowed to never leave home without my personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, the jobs I worked allowed me to be myself, be a little weird, and flex my strangeness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these days, I’ve found myself being more reserved. Thinking twice before posting a blog. Feeling like an impostor writing music or computer code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sometimes I want to shout at the top of my lungs: let’s normalize being weird. Let’s standardize sticking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem is being weird, by definition, is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I will just continue to be weird while the rest of the world pretends to be normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will shun normality, standards, and conformity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I will be free.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why January Is The Worst</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;January is the worst month. It’s a slog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unreasonably cold (relative to your usual weather).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s long (31 days).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s only one holiday (after a couple of months of many days off).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then March comes. And at some point, there will be a temporary warming, a little preview of what spring will bring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for a moment… all is well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How To Eat Better</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2022-01-20-how-to-eat-better/</link>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/posts/2022-01-20-how-to-eat-better/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The secret to eating better was lost on me for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried diet plans, reducing calories, time-restricted eating, the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What eventually worked for me was learning to cook intuitively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to understand what went into making meals: some kind of protein, a starchy carb or vegetable, and perhaps some kind of fat. This is just the formula that I prefer, but could vary depending on who you are.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I learned how to use marinades and spices to make my meals taste more delicious. And, as as result, I now eat better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All meals are composed of whole, unprocessed foods, and unlike in years past, I &lt;em&gt;actually enjoy eating these foods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to eating better is learning how to make food you love.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Roshi</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2021-12-27-my-roshi/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//localhost:1313/posts/2021-12-27-my-roshi/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, here we are: we have a new child in the middle of a turbulent global moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please welcome my second son, Roshi Cadence Hassan. His middle name, Cadence, has meaning in the musical sense: it usually refers to a sequence of chords that end a musical phrase. But it could also refer to a rhythmic flow (many of my colleagues refer to weekly meetings as a “cadence.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as for Roshi: When a Zen practitioner gets trained, they acquire a teacher, affectionately known as Roshi.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Well, here we are: we have a new child in the middle of a turbulent global moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please welcome my second son, Roshi Cadence Hassan. His middle name, Cadence, has meaning in the musical sense: it usually refers to a sequence of chords that end a musical phrase. But it could also refer to a rhythmic flow (many of my colleagues refer to weekly meetings as a “cadence.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as for Roshi: When a Zen practitioner gets trained, they acquire a teacher, affectionately known as Roshi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Roshi uses existential riddles, known as Koans, to bring a zen practitioner to a deeper level of understanding about the nature of reality. These riddles aren’t the kind of logic puzzles you find in activity books; instead, a Zen student must simultaneously hold and let go of their attachment to the problem to come to the solution of the koan. As a result, logic won’t get you anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Roshi once asked me: “What is the one true and pure thing?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Uhh… the universe?” I replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And what’s the universe?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I guess I… don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who is this ‘I’ that you speak of?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Uhhh… don’t…. know?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t know! Nice! Good place to start grappling with this koan!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the next year thinking about it every so often, holding it in my mind like you’d hold sand in your hand, with a soft, delicate grip, not squeezing too hard but not being too careless either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Roshi asks questions that break you down almost to the point of frustration sometimes. Kind of like a young child who asks “why” repeatedly. It was a year and a half after I met with this Roshi that Dezi broke my mind wide open in a way that only a three-year-old can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dada, why does the fridge make that beeping sound?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because it’s letting me know I left the door open.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why did you leave the door open?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because I was distracted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why were you distracted?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because there’s a lot going on at the moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is going on at the moment?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait. Whoah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What IS going on at the moment? Amidst the anxiety, the endless fear, the uncertainty… there is beauty. There is hope. Whatever you need, there it is, right in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right there, my attention returns to what’s essential: the right-nowness of the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s going on at the moment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s my koan. My child has become my Roshi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, in an instant, I now know the one true and pure thing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Real Reason Everyone Hates The Dmv</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine if you arrived and were handed a number. You sit down and watch the numbers scroll through, one by one. You’re #45, and they’re on #17. No problem, you think. It’s a long wait, but it keeps getting closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this isn’t what happens at the DMV. Instead, you get a letter AND a number. And instead of watching a chronological path from a lower number to your higher number, you instead watch as random letters and numbers are called before you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you’re A5, and you just heard A4 called. You might think you’re up next, but then you hear B19 called. Followed by A6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it random? Is there a system? There’s no one to ask, because no one knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not the wait. It’s the uncertainty. It’s the not knowing of how long you’ll be stuck in this non-chronological purgatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s even scarier is that this random and uncertain nature is, as far as I can tell, also how the universe works.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Writing To Persuade Writing To Inform</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2021-04-01-writing-to-persuade-writing-to-inform/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;These are two separate ideas and require two different skillsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psychologist and author Jonathan Haidt describes the human brain like a rider on top of an elephant. The rider takes information and makes sense of it. The rider is logical and rational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elephant, on the other hand, is completely driven by emotion. Primal urges, like hunger, sex, etc control the elephant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you picture the rider on the elephant in your mind, you can see how easily the elephant can control your direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;If you picture the rider on the elephant in your mind, you can see how easily the elephant can control your direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing to inform is what a technical writer does. An engineer writing a very boring spec of some kind of mechanism, for instance. The language is dry but explicit. A person with some content knowledge can use the info to re-create the mechanism. An information writer speaks to the rider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing to persuade, though, is different. Think of a copywriter. A copywriter’s goal is not to inform you about the product; it’s to get you to act (in most cases, buy). The copywriter will create a feeling, an emotional urge inside of you, moving the elephant so fast the rider’s head spins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re out there doing your thing – are you speaking to the rider or the elephant?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Three things I learned this year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainty is an illusion made possible by routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vacating can be spiritual if not physical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can warp time if space provides the necessary conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three things I made this year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A book on education and technology called Inventing the Modern Classroom that I spent a year writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A musical album called Welcome Emotion that I spent every day of the pandemic recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 100 blog posts, which came from subtle glimmers and glints from the world around me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three musical recordings that will stick with me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burt Bacharach and Daniel Tashian – Blue Umbrella (full album) for its simplistic beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Night Game – A Postcard from the City of Angels (album) for its ear worminess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Scheuer – I Am Samantha (single) for its heart wrenching storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three career growth points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got to help school districts and universities figure out how to serve students in a pandemic. I felt like I had something to offer of value, due to the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got to experiment with my own remote teaching ideas with my college class, which many of my students seemed to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did my first voiceover, and although I don’t have the security clearance to see what I look like animated, was still very fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got to help the Aspen Institute pick virtual exchange projects to fund, meeting a lot of interesting and diverse people in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four TV shows that will stick with me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ted Lasso, for its leadership lessons of vulnerability and respect. Pure medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haunting at Bly Manor, for its non-linear storytelling and haunting aesthetic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dash and Lily, because it wrapped me in a very warm blanket&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Midnight Gospel, because it removed me from the universe for 25 mins each episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three new skills I acquired:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powerlifting, which it turns out is just as much a mental game&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life/Engagement Coaching (on my way to being certified), which is a superpower I can’t get enough of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video editing, during the year when teachers became content creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three Podcasts I loved:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akimbo Podcast w/ Seth Godin – Episode: The Zoom Revolution, which explains why online meetings could be so much more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upaya Zen Center Podcast: Waking up in Gendered Bodies (May 10), which explores gender from a Zen buddhist perspective&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poetry Unbound: A Poem for What You Learn Alone (Jan 27), which profoundly changed how I think about learning vs. education vs. school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three books that will stick with me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Untethered Soul by Michael Singer, which taught me how to release energy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Highly Sensitive Man: Finding Strength in Sensitivity, which has helped me understand myself better than I did before&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Courage to be Disliked, which has perhaps the most important lessons and advice on parenting, plus my first real deep dive into Adlerian psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three video games:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celeste, for its perfect mechanics/controls and excellent soundtrack. It taught me how to grind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animal Crossing New Horizons, for being gorgeous and a truly safe space to be myself and experiment and play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journeyman Project: Legacy of Time, which is over 2 decades old but still provided a time travel escape with an old friend over Zoom, something my teenage self would have been thrilled by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>The Fallacy Of Should</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first time I had a therapy session, my therapist asked me how much sleep I get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Less than I should,” I replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She waited a beat, and then said: “There are no shoulds.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took it as a fact, but it took me a while to figure out what it meant. A “should” is a direct link to the expectations of others. If we can define our own values and live by them, and if our values can allow for imperfect behaviors, “should” would dissipate as quickly as it apparated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For some reason, the genre about personal growth and development is labelled as “self help” in book stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, if you read a self-help book, and it helps you… you didn’t help yourself. It was the book. More specifically, it was the author of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; still appropriate to call it self help: the author helped themselves by synthesizing a solution to their own problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone needs a challenging friend or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The type of person who is ready to get in your face, break open your perspectives, and put your viewpoints on trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every friend should be like this. But it’s important to have a few of these kinds of friends on hand and nearby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are your way out of complacency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever been a writer, or pretended to be a writer, then you might know about Julia Cameron’s book, &lt;em&gt;The Artist’s Way&lt;/em&gt;. And if you know that book, then you know the most important part is called Morning Pages, where Cameron teaches how to write, continuously, for 3 pages longhand. No attention paid to the quality of the writing (it’s usually total shit), and no stopping until 3 pages are filled.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The idea is that your mind will pour out onto the page, and now you’ll be deeper into both a flow state and a content fountain by the time you actually sit down to write whatever it is you were planning on writing. Many times, the Morning Pages are disposed of after they are created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a form of mind training; once you do Morning Pages for a few days in a row, you start to realize that your mind is constantly writing a nonsense story as well. You can toss it or keep it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us seek to find inner peace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what other kind of peace is there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If external peace means that no one ever endures conflict, we’ll be waiting quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inner peace is all that matters, because it’s all there is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when I see someone post an alarming article on Facebook (which is most days), I picture what their face looked like as they posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially if the article comes with no commentary from them. As in, they’re just silently slapping a headline in front of thousands of friends and acquaintances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine their eyebrows going up, face full of anxious tension. Then, they post. And then their body calms back down. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It’s a game that social media plays well. It’s the same game that good movies play, and good music. There’s tension and there’s release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It used to be that if we read an alarming article, we had to wait until Sunday dinner with the extended family to talk about it. An alarming news story could stay bottled up inside of us for &lt;em&gt;days. We had to sit with our pain for just a little bit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “reshare” button has given us a way to release tension in the most efficient but least cathartic way possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word “mindful” implies that we’re “full of mind.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a better term might be “mindlessness” because we lose our minds when we meditate or slip into a similar state of awareness (a tea ceremony, perhaps). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when we say we’re being mindless, we mean that we are distracted. But “mindless” is a misomer; really it’s that our mind is full.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m watching a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lj1LYN-D3A&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; right now called Christmas From Another Room, which is not really even much of a video as it is a window into a beautiful calming scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the video, you end up watching (?) 10 hours of snow falling outside of a very festive looking house. A very muted, almost distant soundtrack of beautiful Christmas music plays. It’s the type of feeling you might get in a shopping mall, or in the lobby of a corporate office building.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The channel is called Cozy Ambience, but it’s a whole genre.There are other ‘”cozy ambience” videos from different YouTube accounts. Videos like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rainy Night Coffee Shop Ambience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cozy Cabin Ambience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ancient Library Room&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 hours of Creepy Halloween Night Walk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love these little video painting aural experiences (or whatever you call them). When I work, I tend to avoid listening to music because it’s too distracting. Even ambient music can sometimes distract me. It’s why I mostly listen to recorded natural sounds, like rivers, birds, ocean waves, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But add in the muted, far away music and this is my new go-to work/study atmosphere. On noise cancelling headphones of course.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Empathy is an exercise. A rep of this exercise is considering another person’s point of view, and attempting to wear their shoes, and feel their pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d like to think we are the empathetic type, that we can easily feel the pain of others. But the exercise of empathy works deeper muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can only practice empathy when we disagree, or have a different view, than the person with whom we are empathizing. The act of acknowledging a point of view that is firmly outside our own is the point – the very hallmark! – of the exercise of empathy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The Untethered Soul is a wonderful book on spirituality by Michael Singer. Apparently it resides next to Oprah’s bed. Here are 3 things I learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life will unfold, and the best we can do is to allow it to do so. The more we resist, the more we keep negative energy within us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The inner roommate” is a great way of referring to the monkey mind, the voice that speaks and tells us how worthless we are. We can transcend this voice by realizing that it isn’t us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s Meyers-Briggs or simple astrology (I’m a pisces), people love personality tests. Sure, it’s possible that if you believe in them hard enough, &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; result, even a random one, would make a person say “yeah, that’s me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although some personality tests may have merit, most of what they do is organize our messy mask of a persona into a simple narrative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a gift.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Although some personality tests may have merit, most of what they do is organize our messy mask of a persona into a simple narrative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a gift.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Looking For Comfort On The Internet</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;…is like looking for your reflection in the oven. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s there, but it’s distorted. It isn’t a reflection at all, really. The oven isn’t built for that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oven is built for transformation through intense levels of heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I believe the internet works in the same way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it is advisable not to eat everything that comes out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The exercise your fitness teacher told you about, the one that was _really good for your core, _doesn’t help much in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also need good exercises for your arms, your legs, your back…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the collection that makes a difference, not the individual pieces.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I have a very keen ear. I hear things going on outside of my house even when the windows are closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I heard recently on a late summer night was an echoey, old-timey voice, coming from a nearby house. I opened the window to get a better understanding of what I was hearing: it was the audio from the commentators on an old baseball game. Someone must have been streaming it from YouTube or something, and blasting it through the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Right as I opened the window, I heard the announcer say “Please exit the stadium carefully and drive safely.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who was experiencing this little piece of nostalgia? And why had they blasted it so loudly in my neighborhood? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And most importantly, what did they need?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having a child makes it easy to get sucked into all the kid music. Baby shark, Sesame Street, kids bop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of this stuff is fine to listen to, some of it is not. And remember, you have to listen to these songs on &lt;em&gt;repeat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bu there is no reason for kids music. It doesn’t serve a purpose other than perhaps lyrically, where it might teach an important lesson or be relatable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you ever feel awkward around your friend’s kids, but you don’t want to seem rude, just &lt;em&gt;be curious about whatever they’re&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;curious about.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they’re face down on the floor in a comic book, ask who drew it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they are pulling apart a paperclip, ask about what they’re building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or better yet ask to build it with them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Darkened Room</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many sleep scientists say that the key to healthy sleep is a darkened room. As in, all lights off, all light sources covered (including phones). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this allows the brain to perceive (as our ancestors did) darkness as a cue to fall asleep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is the biggest benefit: it is so damn soothing. It feels a bit like “darkness” therapy as you lie there, eyes open the last minute before you conk out, staring into the exact same darkness that exists behind your eyes, and will eventually lull you to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I was at my parents’ house earlier, on their deck, eating brunch with my family. I haven’t been inside their house, the one I grew up in, since early March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point I pressed my face up to the screen door to look inside. I smelled the same house smell that I had grown up with, the cleaner from the floor, the air freshener, the smell of the furniture. I peered into the same living room where I snuck in alcohol with my high school friends.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;There are certain inflections, certain tones that a person uses when they say certain phrases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy these when I hear them. The slang phrases people use and the perfectly predictable intonation and cadence they use while saying them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to tell them how much I appreciate this about them, but it’s a bit like popping a soap bubble: the act of pointing it out causes consciousness, and along with consciousness comes the tendency to self-edit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Stillness And Business A Continuum</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a continuum in which you have business (busy-ness) on one side and stillness on the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For so long, I was focused on the business part, and from looking at my various media feeds, it seems that the algorithms want to feed me this content as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, I crave stillness too. Of course I do, because too much busy-ness can become overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a good life goal is not to be productive all the time, or to hustle our way to freedom, whatever that means.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it’s finding the optimal balance of busy-ness vs. stillness. If one overpowers the other, we become disoriented.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Voting Is Important But</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve spoken to a number of friends in the last few weeks, and I’ve asked all of them what they are doing to address racial injustice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I just bring it up, other times it comes up naturally. I do not ask in an accusatory way. It’s good to know different ways people are coping with the ongoing tragedy of the unnecessary and unjustified loss of black lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common response I’ve gotten so far is voting. Voting for people who represent anti-racist views is certainly one way to change the system, because it is those people who will propose and enact antiracist legislation. And when I read those long Instagram infographics, they usually end with “and most importantly… vote the racists out of office!”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But it’s not enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply replacing those who promote racist legislation with those who_are more likely to promote_ antiracist legislation will not shift our culture, the way I see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying that you’ll vote for a democrat is often a way of saying “I’d rather check a box than look inward and understand how my contributions keep promoting the inequity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voting is incredibly important. But the &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; is life-long. There’s no way around it. We must commit to it and demand that our politicians commit to it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, we may think we’re making progress when we aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Racist Bones</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After one of the many stories of horrific police brutality against black people, I was on a business trip in Boston interacting with someone I barely knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After this happened, I asked my boss if he thought I was racist,” he told me. “He told me I don’t have a racist bone inside my body.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard this before. The &lt;em&gt;not a racist bone&lt;/em&gt; argument, which absolves the person saying it of all potential racism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard this before. The &lt;em&gt;not a racist bone&lt;/em&gt; argument, which absolves the person saying it of all potential racism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we’ve learned from folks like Ibrahim Kendi that racism is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in the bones, and rather it is a cognitive process of learning that we all engage with in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why we must “do the work” of educating ourselves. Since it’s a matter of fact that we engage with this racist system, we must be aware of its tricks, aware of how it will do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; to sustain itself. Of how it will do anything to keep as many people blinded to its inner workings as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, racism is not in our bones in a physical sense, but it is the bones of our country, a country that was built on a foundation of racism. You may not have racist bones, but you’ve inherited and been programmed into some seriously racist structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Neo leaving the Matrix, many people are starting to understand that there was a whole angle that they couldn’t see before. Like every new season of LOST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Racism is not in our bones, but it is in our ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Whats The Point Of Finishing A Book</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unless you want to, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when people begin posting their tapestry of all the books they’ve read in the year to social media, it’s a vanity metric, as Nadal Ravikant says in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywfx3Um3dsg&#34;&gt;this clip&lt;/a&gt; from Joe Rogan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naval spent his post-school time as a child in the library, where he read everything he possibly could. He did this to satisfy his intellectual curiosity, and when a book no longer served this value, he moved on. He says he has 60-70 books “open” at any point on his Kindle. He flits between all these different tomes given his mood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to say that I read books to completion but it’s not true. I do the same thing Naval does, though when I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; finish a book, I feel victorious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But really, it’s the book and its author that should feel victorious: they held my attention long enough to exhaust the contents of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s quite an achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I tell stories for a living and for my hobbies. The medium through which I tell the story doesn’t matter: it could be a guitar, a microphone, or a coat hanger. The mediums that generate me the most income become my job (technology) and the ones that generate the most satisfaction become my hobbies (songwriting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What draws me to stories, just like everyone else, is their structure; they have a beginning, a middle and an end. It’s a tried and true formula, though some storytellers play with the order of these elements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;I tell stories for a living and for my hobbies. The medium through which I tell the story doesn’t matter: it could be a guitar, a microphone, or a coat hanger. The mediums that generate me the most income become my job (technology) and the ones that generate the most satisfaction become my hobbies (songwriting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What draws me to stories, just like everyone else, is their structure; they have a beginning, a middle and an end. It’s a tried and true formula, though some storytellers play with the order of these elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these past few weeks, I’ve realized how much that structure gives life its meaning. There are stories all around us: news stories, social media posts, YouTube scripts, classroom lectures, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there isn’t a beginning to a story, we write it in. It’s why origin stories are so appealing – you can finally find out the beginning of the (larger) narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also write in an ending if we don’t know it. It’s why the idea of religion/heaven is so appealing, or why so many news articles makes predictions about coronavirus as if they are clairvoyant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with stories that are still “in-process,” that have a beginning and endless middle, is that we want to skip to the ending as soon as it gets boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’d be nice to know how the pandemic ends. Many popular blog posts and videos pontificate about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’d be nice to know when and how black lives get justice. Here, in the endless middle of the story, it’s hard to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every person that commits to being anti-racist has to deal with just how infinite the middle of the story feels right now. How much work there is to be done. How much reflecting. How much self-questioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The middle can go on for quite some time. And along the way, there will be victories as well as setbacks. There will be different perspectives. There will be lives whose endings came before their middles were done middling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to be comfortable with the fact that &lt;em&gt;there is no ending&lt;/em&gt; to this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe life is less like those narratives we love and more like a sine wave. It goes up and it comes down, scraping gently against the center.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every day, the sea becomes land and the land becomes sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transformation is natural and inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t escape it any more than a caterpillar escapes her eventual form.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>No Gatekeepers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the arguments that many new media folks will invoke is that there are no longer any gatekeepers. It used to be that we had to create a piece of art that spoke to someone’s taste. That person, an A&amp;amp;R rep or whatever, would be the gatekeeper to the audience or the recording deal that we needed to be a massive success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, almost anyone can get famous if they have good enough content. The cream rises to the top. Or does it?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Now, almost anyone can get famous if they have good enough content. The cream rises to the top. Or does it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider that there are videos that go viral because they’re good content. They were in the right place at the right time, and so they achieved an audience. I had a video that did this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are some channels and creators that have a formula for creating viral content. They create an interesting screen cap or use a headline that is alarming or intriguing. Their content is made with the knowledge of how the particular social network works. You can become a star on tik tok for instance, if you just adhere to the culture and post videos like the ones that are successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re no longer kept behind the gate by people… but perhaps the new gatekeeper that we need to impress is the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this a better scenario?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of my problems do not come with a money back guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my problems are not cheap. They are investment products. They contain a portfolio, with values and returns fluctuating on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my problems are not created by society.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Its Like To Be Late</title>

&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, my job has required me to be on time. No more showing up a few minutes late to something as I’ve done my whole life. I had to learn how to be on time, which meant actually showing up &lt;em&gt;early&lt;/em&gt;. And quite a bit early, at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the rare event that I am late to something, the feeling is so familiar that it’s almost visceral. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But on the rare event that I am late to something, the feeling is so familiar that it’s almost visceral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way it feels: you leave with enough time that you’ll make it, at least you think. And at some point, you hit traffic or the GPS recalculates, or you forget something and have to go back. Then, you realize you’ll arrive in the parking lot right at the time that your meeting is supposed to start. But you worry that you’ll end up circling the parking lot trying to find visitor parking for a while. All of this boils up rather quickly and can turn into road rage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re walking to a meeting, sometimes you might burst into a sprint and still be late, but now you’re late and out of breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m glad I don’t feel this kind of stress much anymore (especially now, with quarantine). But I look forward to the time when I am &lt;em&gt;able&lt;/em&gt; to feel this sort of feeling again.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wonder why we it’s named “the living room?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name came from the French, who decided it should be called that since the activities that happen in the room were lively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what is a lively activity? One with many people, I suppose. A social gathering. How is this living in a different sense that when we’re alone, or mourning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it’s the conversation, the exchange of stories, that constitute the idea of living. That each one of us, separately, can’t really live without interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What People Leave Behind</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of the stuff that the previous owners of our house kept here has been moved out, with some tiny exceptions. You can see in some rooms the little bumps that the spackle left behind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also stickers that presumably never came off. There are a couple of kid-looking stickers still on the window and one on the stove. I’m guessing they were difficult to remove. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it makes me curious: why were these stickers used in the first place? Were there children who just got bored and stuck them on things in the house? Was it a bonding activity? Did it come from a family who lived here even before them, and they wondered the same thing?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The things that people leave behind may have tremendous sentimental value. Or not. Or somewhere in the middle. We’ll never know.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting to me to watch people during this pandemic. Everyone’s coping methods are on full display whether they want them to be or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those coping methods is one that I’ve witnessed for quite a while, which is giving advice on social media. Advice that doesn’t apply to everyone, even though the person posting wouldn’t believe that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of re-sharing on social media. And it’s nothing new. I read an emotionally charge piece (which is almost all pieces) and then click re-share so that other people _feel what I’m feeling – right now. _&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It’s a coping strategy that works a bit like a virus itself. I share an emotion (through a charged news story) with my 2,000 friends. Some of them go and share it with their 2,000 friends… and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And pretty soon we’re all panicking and no one is sure where it all started.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Its Always Critical To Be Yourself</title>

&lt;p&gt;Consider that we all come prepackaged with a unique set of DNA. The instructions that tell us who we are (some might call nature) varies from person to person. And so does our personal experiences (what some might call nurture).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing these two facts, it’s _crucial _that we all continue to be ourselves. We must allow our unique values and beliefs to inform our choices (and if you don’t know your values or beliefs, no better time to start thinking about them). &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The more we all do this, the more perspectives we have available (and if you’ve written your ideas down or transmitted them to younger generations verbally, yours can be available even after you’re dead). The more perspectives we have, the more realized society becomes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to know when you’ve made a mistake and offended your own values. But say no to changing who you are just because another person disapproves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought in the last couple of days about giving up writing this blog. It’s an amazing creative exercise, to wake up every day and write about a different topic that I find interesting or fascinating. Very few people read it, though occasionally someone will want to chat about a topic I’ve written about, which is always rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, in this time of very little time, I felt that it made sense to stop writing for a bit. It would give some time back into the schedule that I’m currently dividing between my job and my child. I could return to the blog when things quieted down again. But then, I decided against it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it would save time, but I think it’s important to keep writing especially in hard times like the ones we’re going through now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because when I day, whether that’s sooner or later, my words and thoughts could continue to have an impact, even when I’m gone. And I’ve said before this is the closest thing to immortality that I know of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you are inspired by something you read here, or anywhere, I encourage you to write or speak or whatever it is you do to express yourself. The world needs it, and it will inspire more people to create things that are important to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s something we need right now, more than anything.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We humans have an interesting way of deciding what’s real and what’s not real. We give things meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they make synthetic diamonds in a lab, who’s to say they aren’t “real?” Sure, they aren’t real in the context of our definition of diamonds. But they are as real as anything else in this world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decide meaning, based on context, and in doing so, we decide what is real.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s another interesting subreddit I sometimes look at called r/namenerds. It’s exactly what the name implies; these are people who geek out over names. They love names that string together well, first and last initials, nicknames, name rhythms, unique names, pet names, and everything in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It occurred me to that these are, in the end, lovers of poetry. What is a name of it isn’t poetry? Why do we seek to know the meaning of people’s names if it doesn’t unlock some curious part of us? &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;When we give a child or a pet a new name, we think carefully about what it will mean based on on the lens through which we’ve lived our lives, the people we’ve met, and the way that certain phonemes make us feel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fascinated. How much does someone’s name influence who they are?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Poetry Vs Language</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can’t really separate the two because all language &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider that in Spanish, “I missed the bus” becomes “the bus missed me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the fact that some authors, when their books are translated, fine the translations to be more beautiful and paradoxical than they could have ever imagined in their native language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the fact that when we talk in conversation, we’re constantly making metaphors, connecting the dots of our brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Consider news articles that use language to make us inspired or scared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the format of this blog post, which now looks more like a poem than a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can’t just give facts without coloring those facts with our own poetry. Whether we intend to or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people argue, there’s a tendency to be polite, and to say “yeah exactly!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It happens even when we disagree. “Yeah, exactly! But…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s important to vehemently disagree or agree in a conversation with opinions. If this becomes common practice, we will eventually work ourselves out of the idea of wanting to be agreeable and likeable and safe all the time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing wrong with being agreeable of course, but it may be unhealthy to do it for the wrong reasons. We don’t sit down and talk about our opinions just to restate the opinions we’ve already formed (that’s what social media is for). We do it to change, to come to agreements, to develop new ideas that could never have happened in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, it’s the inter_change_ that makes _change _happen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At a workshop once, the participants were asked to write out their values, the things that were important to them in life. Among the responses, people said their family, friends, art, and their passions were among the most valued things their life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they were asked to write what they do with most of their days. Among these responses were “email, scrolling social media, having meetings…” etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How close do your values match what you do every single day? Perhaps you feel it’s out of your control. But this exercise of comparing your values to your daily activities can help empower you. It can inform you. It can help you understand that you have more control than you think.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was in a lecture recently where someone referenced this quote: “We are not human beings having a spiritual experience; we are spiritual beings having a human experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like this interpretation. For me, a spiritual being is the person you are now, but also the person you were before you were born, and the person you’ll be after you die. Maybe person isn’t even the right word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lineage through it all, a thread. The thing that connects me to my ancestors and that connects my future children, great grandchildren and so on, all the way back to me in the present moment. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Journal The Notebook And The Diary</title>

&lt;p&gt;For most of my life, these three terms seemed to blur together. But I was asked recently about the difference, and it made me think. And whenever I think, I write. The following is my opinion on semantics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A diary is a place to log your life events. My British cousins often refer to their calendars as diaries for instance. It’s a place that is separated by dates, where each date is a unique record of information. For me, this means that I write in a diary every day to log my activities. I can refer back whenever I need to. I have hashtags in my DayOne app for when I’m sick, what my symptoms are, what trips I’ve been on, what books I’ve read, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A notebook is a place for observation and retention. This is the place where your mind can roam free. It’s your soul on paper. I combine my diary and notebook using the DayOne app. So not only do I log my events, but I write my analyses and insights in this space as well. I choose to combine the diary and notebook because it just makes the most sense for how I process thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A journal is where you might evidence of a &lt;em&gt;journey&lt;/em&gt;. It takes the thoughts and analyses from the notebook into more of a forward thinking state. This is the place where dreams are planned, and ideas come alive. A journal is artistic, even for an audience of one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, of course, much overlap. I started by saying that this was my opinion on semantics, but in this case, I think the semantics matter. Regardless of the container of your thoughts, and regardless of how you combine these elements… the way in which you process your thoughts matter. And the products of writing are infinitely more tangible than the products of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A fun way to parent is to play throw &amp;amp; catch with your child. This isn’t limited to balls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One version of it is when I’m in the car with my son and he throws out “dada!” I catch and respond with “Dezi!” Throw and a catch. He says “Dada!” again and on it goes until one of us gets distracted by something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or if we’re playing with his ukulele, and he’ll play a chord and hand me the instrument. I’ll play a chord and hand it back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>7 Pairs Of Socks</title>

&lt;p&gt;I needed new socks recently so I went to Ross, where I found a set of 7 on sale for $7. When I got home, I realized that each of these pairs was a different color, and each of them had a different day of the week on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a minute, I thought about the possibility of just buying another set and wearing these socks exclusively. It would be a ritual, a way of starting my day. I’d put on the sock that corresponded to the day of the week as a way to greet the morning, to prepare myself for the work of the day, to ground myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Kind of like how Steve Jobs wore the same outfit every day to minimize his decision paralysis. Or how I used to wear the same suit for each day of the week when I was a teacher (decision paralysis is particularly paralyzing for teachers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, what ended up happening is that the pairs got separated and strewn all over the place. I don’t really even try to match them anymore when they’re out of the dryer. Another attempt at structure thwarted by friction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When we say we’re lost in thought, we mean that we started listening a little too closely to the narratives in our head. We started watching thoughts like a movie, getting invested in the plot, the characters, the fictional elements of the past and future events of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; gets lost, exactly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; who gets lost in thought. _Me _is still driving. _Me _is still on a conference call. &lt;em&gt;Me&lt;/em&gt; isn’t lost in anything. &lt;em&gt;Me&lt;/em&gt; is the one having thoughts to begin with, so _who _is getting lost exactly? This question is much more important than its answer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Nice days are made by the blood, sweat, and tears of the not so nice days. They’re constructed, carefully, to appear in a flash sometimes when everything has gone to shit, and everyone is desperate. That’s when we have nice days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we can also create nice days in a flash. Instead of saying &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; a nice day, we could choose to say &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; a nice day. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Do I leap out of bed and dig in to my day? Or do I do what my body clearly wants to do and sleep in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I spend the day checking email and Facebook or do I do something more productive? My intuition says this is a day for celebration, the act of marking one’s pleasure by doing an enjoyable activity. And enjoyable to me means I take control, instead of algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Rewind to 1999. I’ve got a cd wallet in my car that has about 12-15 slots for CDs. I’m at the second hand record shops every week selling old CDs and buying new ones. I’ve got a boom box and I’ve split its speakers across my room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m probably playing my music too loud. Keeping my parents up. So I switch to headphones and surf the web. This was back when I could do both things at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It’s too much now, of course. I can’t focus on music while I’m fighting people in my head on social media. I can’t put on an album in the car without switching to a different one, although I would’ve done this much more in the 90’s if it were easier (I listened to tapes until about 97).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make playlists too, so switching between albums is automated. Before, I’d get lost in an artist’s world; now, they get lost in mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was talking to someone recently who said they’re done with music, they prefer podcasts. No disrespect. It’s just that I wonder if it’s music that sucks or our ways of consuming it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could we return to a simpler time? Only by giving up convenience and novelty and algorithms. Only by returning to searching the bins at a record store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that the human body is full of complex systems, and that there are organisms, disorders, and syndromes that can invade and attack those systems, the body is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; an amazingly protective piece of machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was fretting over the Coronavirus, I started to feel sick myself. I began having symptoms, like a runny nose, and a slight cough. It lasted about 24 hours and then I was seemingly back to normal. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;While I was fretting over the Coronavirus, I started to feel sick myself. I began having symptoms, like a runny nose, and a slight cough. It lasted about 24 hours and then I was seemingly back to normal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s quicker than I usually recover from an illness. I attribute it to the fact that over the year or so I’ve completely switched my diet to (mostly) whole foods, I’ve reduced my diet soda intake, and I’ve developed a serious strength training regimen that I perform 3 times a week. I’ve also started a meditation practice that I’ve been engaging with every day for the past half-year or so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that it is these elements, and the fact that I spend my days doing work I love, that have made my body more efficient in fighting off illnesses. It’s kind of like your parents and doctor always said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even without these habits in place, the human body is still incredible and adaptive. For instance, my muscles seem to be bigger just from putting them under stress. And the splinter I somehow got into my thumb a while ago has been working its way out for months. I’ve been curiously watching my body do its thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I have a new ritual. Whenever I heal, even if the infection or wound was trivial, I thank my body, out loud, for everything it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When things get gory toward the end. I’m not a fan of gratuitous violence really, even though I do love most of the Tarantino movies. A good story really makes the violence seem necessary to move the plot forward, and in this case, it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The father and son communicating via morse code at the end, as well as the inclusion of morse code in general.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The scene where the family camps out in the mansion while the owners are away. The pacing here, the level of escalation per moment, was extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved the way it’s hard to pin down exactly what genre this movie fits in. It was hilarious and sad and scary and horrific and joyful all in one go. Will definitely watch again.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A popular subreddit is r/amitheasshole. In this forum, people encounter daily experiences where they feel that they’ve been wronged or disrespected interpersonally. They ask the forum if they are, in fact, the asshole, and not the other person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this tradition. We have this tendency to believe that we’re right, no matter what. There are interpersonal situations where I’ve felt &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; that I was in the right, only to hear the other person talk about me like I was crazy, and they were sure that &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; were in the right.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;With this subreddit, whenever people get mad or upset about an interpersonal situation, they develop the habit of stopping and considering how much of the situation was their fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s the social feedback that makes this most effective. I don’t think this sort of thing would’ve been possible before the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I listened to a recent On Being episode with Jill Tarter, co-founder of SETI, an organization that tries to detect signals from distant planets and galaxies. She’s the one who inspired Jodie Foster’s character in the movie Contact, which is one of my favorites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting points she made is that a signal coming from a galaxy in distant space would take so long to reach us that the civilization who sent the message might already be gone. She goes on to make the point that this would still have tremendous value even if we couldn’t communicate back with this civilization. In the same way that we learn and grow from reading Shakespeare (or any dead author), we can learn from a civilization that no longer exists. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;There are some, like author Alan Jacobs who even say that we’re &lt;em&gt;better off&lt;/em&gt; interacting with dead authors. Jacobs has an upcoming book called Breaking Bread with the Dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are those in my friend group who I would describe as best friends. If I had to identify one common thread that links them together, it is that they are all really good at &lt;em&gt;letting me arrive at my own conclusions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something I value in a friendship, and it’s also something I try to instill in my own life as a trainer, consultant, and college professor. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;That said, it is very hard sometimes to _not _give advice. Especially for me, as my natural instinct has traditionally to “fix” problems. It might be related to my love of technology (problems that &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be solved). But I also have developed of the human psyche, which presents problems that may never be solved, but can be explored, interrogated, and transformed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Much Do We See</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you’ve on Instagram or Facebook or some other service, it’s important to stop and ask occasionally how much of someone’s life you’re seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I see people they’ll often say, “well, looks like you’re doing great!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I respond that I am, but I always wonder how they feel so confident .After all, I generally don’t post my fears and anxieties and insecurities to social media (I save that for this blog).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I respond that I am, but I always wonder how they feel so confident .After all, I generally don’t post my fears and anxieties and insecurities to social media (I save that for this blog).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only post the happy and useful things, the things that (mostly) make people smile. I run the thoughts and events of my life through a filter so that what comes out is sparkly and shiny on the other end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m more complex than that. And so are you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can’t separate our life into negative and positive things that easily without the presentation opportunity that social media gives us. Because the experiencing of separating like this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a negative experience. Which means that when we cull the pieces of our lives and decide what to showcase, we’re actively having a negative experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t advocate, however, being more open and honest about your insecurities on social media, unless you want to. I don’t think that helps either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s about transcending the need to filter, leaving behind the desire to showcase, and instead pursuing real-life human connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most prominent features of a diet is restrictions. Some diets restrict calories, while other diets restrict certain macronutrients. But the more coherent doctors that I’ve heard speak indicate that macronutrients (protein, fat, and carbs) are actually &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; good. That it’s more about how our body processes certain types of foods, particularly processed food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a parallel when it comes to emotions. I grew up being told to stop being sensitive, to contain my sadness, my anger, and other so-called negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Like the macronutrients, we might want to move toward a future where _all _emotions are good emotions, and we focus more on how our body (and mind) processes these emotions. The way I processed sadness, for a long time, was to throw a clock of anger over it, for instance. It wasn’t that sadness was bad; it was that I wasn’t aware of how my brain processed sadness. I wasn’t aware of the alternative ways of processing that therapy has now given me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s different than reading a magazine article, or even a book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A poem affords a certain kind of freedom to its creator, the type of rule-less-ness that produces creativity, that connects disjointed ideas, that makes a person see themselves in the past, present, and future all at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can let poems guide us, both in reading them and writing them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I’m talking about the type of poetry that is just a few lines long, that seems more like a sentence with line breaks than what we consider a poem to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m not so sure it’s inherently bad. People read these poems; it brings them joy; they reshare. If the poems were bad, this wouldn’t happen. They certainly aren’t traditional, and that’s bound to piss a few people off. English majors, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I was speaking to a musician friend who went to 7-8 years of training at top institutions. He said it bothered him when he’d try and get a gig and the gig would go to “some guy with a guitar” who barely knows how to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, that guy with a guitar is getting work. Even though he didn’t go to music school, the world wants what he’s got. Even if purists think it’s a rejection of craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what matters most, at the end of it all, is what moves people. The authority that elitists think they have is actually self-generated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A fun game to play: go to a Target with a friend or sibling, or any shopping mall that sells perfume. Take turns smelling perfume scents and guessing what the scent is titled. Check to see how close you were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is the realization that the names are relatively arbitrary. Candles scents are more in line with reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A title gives a product a concrete identity. But it doesn’t change the underlying qualities of the product. However, it can change the perception of that product, which can affect the product’s usefulness, strangely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We can use a stimulus to activate dopamine. We can take a chemical to activate more brain chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s like our brain is just sitting there, &lt;em&gt;begging&lt;/em&gt; to be stimulated. The things with which we stimulate it vary from person to person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sunset, moonlight, an incredible film, a moving song… non-chemicals that induce chemical reactions, or chemicals that induce chemical reactions. It doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all cases, we’re setting off fireworks with each and every move, and we’re watching them dissipate, staying ready for more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was talking with a friend about whether or not we’re “weird.” And I’m sure many people have described me as weird, but those are the people that don’t really connect to me. They aren’t concerned with what I’m concerned about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, I’m the type of person that could fall down the YouTube rabbit hole on the most random subjects, I could learn the ins and outs of microphones or tennis balls or what is the nicest pencil. I could discover the end of the rainbow if I tried, I really could.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This is a misnomer. Once of the classic texts in Zen literature is Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind by Suzuki. Among other points, he rightly claims that every time we meditate, regardless of how many years experience we have doing it, we’re always starting at the same place. We’re always a beginner. No one has mastered Zazen. Not even those who consider themselves enlightened. Perhaps &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; those who consider themselves enlightened. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

Among other points, he rightly claims that every time we meditate, regardless of how many years experience we have doing it, we’re always starting at the same place. We’re always a beginner. No one has mastered Zazen. Not even those who consider themselves enlightened. Perhaps &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; those who consider themselves enlightened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once read a John Mayer interview years ago where he said that every time he writes a song, he feels like it’s the first time he’s ever written anything. The same fears, the same doubts, the same creative struggle, even with many hit records and awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we ever leave the beginner stage? Perhaps in some ways. But when we’re creating a piece of art from scratch, or a quiet moment, or sitting zazen… it’s &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s an important distinction. We trick ourselves most of the time. Especially with anything that involves the memory of the past. And definitely for what we believe the future holds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, time and space are illusions. We trust that they are what we think they are. Everyone has to believe in time for it to work properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But delusion happens when only a small group or individual puts faith in an illusion. It’s a judgment, relative to all of the other false beliefs we inherit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Diet trends are fascinating to watch. They come, they go, they morph and they reappear under different names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A popular idea right now is that of intuitive eating. Rather than stick to calorie limits or re-balance macronutrients, the idea is simply that you listen to your body and stop eating when you’re full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is most likely the healthiest way to approach weight loss/healthy eating, once you understand what “full” means (many of us think of “full” as “stuffed.”) &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting to watch my son engage with intuitive eating. He’s a ferocious eater and will usually take more food than most of his peers, but he knows when he’s done. And I know this because he says “done.” He could cry his face off for just one more spoonful of hummus (his current favorite) and then be “done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He doesn’t have to think about food after the food is done. He’s hungry and then he wants. He’s full and then he doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to be more like him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone refers to me as an expert on &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;, I always do a double take. I get the urge to defend myself and say I’m not an expert in anything. I’m a learner, and I’ll always see myself that way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe being confident in your decisions is what people refer to when it comes to expert. Not the amount of knowledge you have, but the amount of skill you can apply.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Who exactly gets “snubbed” when they aren’t given an award?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re focused on the award more than we are focused on the way that art moves us emotionally. Of course, it makes sense that we’d want the official group in charge to validate our emotional connection to art. And of course, it feels good to recognize the voices of those who are marginalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is it necessary to elevate voices beyond the art that has already gotten them a nomination at the Oscars? If we are to put any stock into winning this ceremony, then surely a nomination is quite an accomplishment as well, and also recognition of exemplary work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Does a win mean the movie or director was inherently better? And is ranking movies or any art a useful practice?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As we plan our summer, I’m reminded of a very important fact: vacating (the verb associated with vacation) has always led to a good piece of art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite songs I’ve ever written was the result of a trip to Singapore and Malaysia. I’ve finished huge projects before while traveling due to downtime and being outside of my routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always complain during long trips that they’re &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; long. But it’s the space that makes them work, the distance that opens my brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can’t really do it on purpose. A childhood memory that lasts forever seems to happen out of nowhere, a flash of lightning, an experience where novelty and curiosity come together so seamlessly it leaves you changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I ever visited a good friend in the tiny town of Evanston, Wyoming, during high school we had a fantastic time going around the town, watching fireworks, playing video games, and talking to girls.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The next summer, we did it again, only it wasn’t the same. We tried to do the same stuff we did the previous summer, but re-creating the experience proved to be less interesting than having it spontaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My son is going through a process of creating childhood memories now. The funny thing is that he doesn’t yet know which will become lasting memories, which of these curious and novel moments will shape the person he will eventually become. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m excited to find out, one day, if any of the memories that were formative for me as a parent were also formative for him as a child.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Secret To Producing A Lot Of Writing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s clear to anyone that follows my work that I write a lot. A book last month, a blog post every day, and then there’s all the writing I do that no one but me sees, like in my journal (the DayOne app). Then there are all the lists I make, the notes and observations I take in the Drafts app that end up becoming these blog posts. It’s a lot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Then there are all the lists I make, the notes and observations I take in the Drafts app that end up becoming these blog posts. It’s a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many secrets to producing a lot of writing. One, of course is not caring about the writing being perfect. I have a book of essays based on blog posts that I’ve been compiling over the last few years, for instance, and I’ve been refining and expanding on some of the ideas that I post here. It’s useful… but once you get past that, there’s another important thing to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s your tools. What are you writing with? I went through a period of searching for the perfect mechanical keyboard. It &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to be mechanical if it’s going to be any good, because the tactile nature of the switches make typing much faster. I was able to reach speeds of 140wpm when I used certain keyboards. The iPhone keyboard works in a pinch for me but it’s not even close to what I can do with my Das Pro 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I originally opted for cherry mx blue key switches but found them a bit too clicky. I never thought I’d enjoy using brown switches but on this keyboard, I can really fly. There’s just enough of a tactile bump that I can type without “bottoming out” (pressing the key all the way down). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took some trial and error and even some selling of keyboards that didn’t meet the mark (though were highly regarded in the mechanical keyboard community).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend trying a few mechanicals, if you write a lot or even want to write a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite parts of parenting are the snuggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, it’s the part of parenting almost everyone loves. But my son, between months 3 and 6, learned to put his head on my shoulder when I picked him up. I knew it wouldn’t last forever, but at the time it was one of the best feelings I’ve ever experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He still does it, but mostly when he’s sick or really tired. And the past week, he’s had the flu. My mom came over to watch him while I went to a meeting, and when I was holding him she said, “Oh, look, he’s rubbing your back!”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;And it was true. As he was snuggled onto my shoulder, he was using his hand to gently rub my back. It wasn’t just cute, it was healing. A one and a half year old with the flu soothing &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; in his own bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized how he learned this, which is that &lt;em&gt;I’m&lt;/em&gt; the one that rubs his back when he’s sick and on my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kids copy their parents, but I didn’t realize that they reciprocate care in this way. It’s beautiful and special. And hopefully it will continue to grow and change in ways that I never could have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The items that are eye level were put there by marketers who paid extra to have their items at eye level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a subtle manipulation but an important one: we don’t pick our food, our food (and its makers) pick us. Unless we actively go out of our way to avoid the manipulation, like people who only shop at Farmers markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not the only capitalist-style manipulation in my life. The internet seems to morphing into one huge manipulation, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;And that is, the idea of regret. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met a friend in High School who said that he wants to have no regrets at all. The idea was foreign to me at the time, but when I started to think about it, I realized the implications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;You can really make most any mistake and immediately forgive yourself and move on. There are exceptions of course, like if you were to really be malicious or irresponsible and cause harm to another person. But I feel that if your goal is to have no regrets, you’ll do everything you can to avoid those types of situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last thing I want is for my deathbed self-talk to be about how I should have less regrets. In other words, if regretting regret is the last thing I do, I’ll have to finally conquer regret in those final moments in the saddest way possible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning, I read Mark Manson’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://markmanson.net/why-you-should-quit-the-news&#34;&gt;assessment&lt;/a&gt; that most news is irrelevant and not actually useful. I’ve long felt this way about most social media posts; that either someone is posting something helpful intentionally, or they are posting something that increases their own status and doesn’t really help anyone but themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never thought of news as having the same quality, but now that I’ve read Mark’s piece… &lt;em&gt;of course it does.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I never thought of news as having the same quality, but now that I’ve read Mark’s piece… &lt;em&gt;of course it does.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His recommendation is to find high quality sources of news that cost money. Something I’ve actually longed for with social media as well. Equity is important, and it’s true that many social platforms have given voices to those who were voiceless before. But it’s also created an untenable system of anxiety that I feel is more detrimental than the effect of the problem it solves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d rather pay for a service that allows me to see news that is relevant to me, and posts from friends and family that I really care about (as opposed to the high school friends who I’m curious about never actually see).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With subscription fees, we reduce the need for advertising and “clicks.” We can just enjoy life without being manipulated by the market. But it requires us, as a society, to acknowledge this problem and spend money on a solution (none come to mind just yet). If we can afford phone service, we can afford a social media or news service that actually serves us, rather than a service that makes us the product.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Worry is a choice. And it’s one I choose quite a bit. No one has ever been successful with “don’t worry,” unless the initial worry was small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life’s anxieties have a way of attaching to the brain like a leech. Words and reassurances aren’t powerful enough to unstick or unseat that which has burrowed itself so deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the “you” that is under all of the thinking is &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; worried. The observer, the true self, the Buddha mind, whatever you call it… doesn’t care a bit about your upcoming nerve wracking presentation at work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s a game we sometimes play in the classroom. Someone will say “I like basketball,” and if that applies to others, they’ll spring forward into the circle, saying “That’s me!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps we see a meme or a photo that we can relate to and we think, “Oh, that’s so me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know my interests and my disinterests. I know my favorite movies and TV shows. I know what routes I like to take, physically and metaphysically.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I know my interests and my disinterests. I know my favorite movies and TV shows. I know what routes I like to take, physically and metaphysically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes I wish I knew “me” better. The “me” behind all of that other stuff. The me that’s watching and observing me combat life and all of it’s joy and pain. Who is that person? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People talk about “finding themselves” as if “themself” is some distant character, lost out there in the darkness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get it. I don’t know “me” as well as I should. But maybe it’s less about finding, and more about noticing what’s already there, right in front of my face.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Paid Forward</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was in a Barnes and Noble once browsing the history shelves. I was teaching a fourth grade unit on the revolution, something I hadn’t really absorbed much as a child, and I wanted to become somewhat of an expert. Hamilton (the musical) had just come out, which helped aid some of my work with the students. I remember telling them that it would be one of the most important musicals of all time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Hamilton (the musical) had just come out, which helped aid some of my work with the students. I remember telling them that it would be one of the most important musicals of all time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the books I pulled out was Meecham’s book on Thomas Jefferson. As I was looking at the book, a lady stopped by and said “that’s one of my favorites.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Really? I’m trying to teach my students about the revolution. Was just looking through some of these books…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Get that one,” she said. “Trust me. I’m a history buff. It’s fantastic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a little more looking, I ended up figuring that I’d go online to find more reviews and resources about what I should read. As I came down the escalator, the woman that had approached me was standing there with a bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Here,” she said. Inside the bag was the Jefferson book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wow. Thanks. Can I get your name, at least?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nope,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we were both off. I still haven’t read the book. But the experience of connecting with someone and receiving an anonymous gift was invigorating. I await the next time that I can receive or give a gift in this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was technically born right around the cusp of the start of the millennial. It makes me an &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; millennial, or someone who only partially grew up with the internet. I still remember a time when I didn’t have the internet, but it wasn’t the internet that changed things for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve written about finite collections before. In today’s streaming playlist culture, I’ve ordered a stack of cheap CDs for my son to explore one day. That’s how I learned, through scrounging around in my dad’s record collection. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The difference between my age group and the next one (or maybe the next next one) is that for a while there, even when the internet was available on everyone’s computer via dial up modem, we still found of our favorite things offline. Most of my favorite musicians were found via MTV or radio still, my friends were still recommending things to me… there were no recommendation algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used to find things offline but then learn more about them online via fan sites, blogs, and the occasional video file that took forever to download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today’s kids get to discover things much earlier. And a &lt;em&gt;plethora&lt;/em&gt; of things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if, in the future of best parenting practices, doctors and psychologists will recommend that we provide finite collections of materials for children, so that when they discover the infinite internet, they will at least have some armor and a sense of duty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every system in life requires balance; therefore every system requires a budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diet requires a budget of energy. How much do you spend? How much do you save or consume? The answer to this equation is different for every person but important to consider. Those who don’t might end up trying to fix a mess later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitness is the same. Can I increase the amount of energy expended, and how should I then consume calories/energy to compensate?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The same goes for joy and fear. How much do you budget joy? How do you spend your mental energy on fear appropriately? How much do you overspend? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budgets make life worth living because they provide balance between work and recovery. When we talk about work life balance, or a balanced diet, or an effective workout program… we’re talking about balancing the budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The age old debate rages on: are we like this because that’s how we were made, or are we like this because society has given us a superficial roadmap?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve started to believe that it doesn’t matter much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, for most of us, this sort of inquiry is mostly for fun, at least when we talk on a societal scale. What’s more pressing is those who are in front of us everyday: our kids, our spouses, our parents, our friends. And even if we figured out that our friend is angry all the time because he has some kind of gene that causes anger, and his mother had it and so on… it doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Isn’t nurturing still a part of nature? And doesn’t nature have the ability to nurture us? The way a waterfall changes us, a natural being influencing another natural being. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And isn’t nature still a part of nurturing? Isn’t society and all of its flaws and beauties simply a byproduct of the natural unfolding of the cosmos?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I plan for my upcoming course, I keep thinking about what qualities make up the best classes. One of the most important creative qualities that we can cultivate in a class of students is vulnerability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always felt somewhat vulnerable, in life. Sometimes to my detriment. Other times, it’s helped with whatever I’m doing, especially if what I’m doing is something creative. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The assumption behind vulnerability is that you’re not the only one that has insecurities and fears; that everyone has these, and instead of working really hard to hide all of the rough stuff, we acknowledge that fear of being misunderstood is part of the human experience. When the walls of protectiveness fall away, we can be collaborative, productive, and kind.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What are you to do when everyone disagrees? With your choices, with your art, with your life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, I thought this kind of peer feedback was a built-in safety mechanism. My friends would _never _let me do something so stupid as to release a book, or record an album, and embarrass myself. Or wear a yellow wristband with a pink Z, or drink pink cocktails as man, or…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what to do when you feel so comfortable in your choices that you can’t imagine an alternative and yet everyone laughs, questions, or pokes?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;You calmly explain to them, one at a time, that we all think differently. Cognitive and neurodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That there are some who think in shapes and concepts, and some who think in words and sentences. It’s often hard for me, as a person who thinks in words, to really be accepted by someone who thinks in shapes and concepts. It’s like we’re talking in two different languages if we ever get below the small talk, even though both of us speak perfectly good English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put me in a room of graphic designers, and you can pretty much find me curled up in a corner feeling like a total idiot, while in a room of songwriters my ideas might be seen as creative and compelling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I plan the syllabus for my upcoming college course, I find myself thinking about rewards and gamification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gamification, that buzzword that everyone wants to “try” is actually something we’ve been doing for quite a while using points. If you’ve ever received x amount of points out of y, and you’ve had to total those points up for an entire semester’s worth of work to calculate your grade, then you’ve played a game.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This is how I “gamed” the system in high school: get just enough points to be considered a decent student and nothing more. I didn’t care about getting first place. Second or third or fourth even was just fine with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, I’ve been against rewards in the classroom, other than the intrinsic one of learning. They end up motivating a little too well, and then it becomes hard to teach without them because students come to expect them. When I had a class of 4th graders, I tried to avoid rewards but I made an an exception for rewards that had educational value, like books or puzzles. There was a girl once who was new to the US, and she once got a reward of a Wreck This Journal, which is a fun guided type of journal for kids (there are pages that you are required to get dirty, take in the shower, bury in the ground outside, etc). The experience, according to her, was life changing. And it wouldn’t have happened if I hadn’t caved to the idea of a reward.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the longest I’ve ever left the blog without posting. For the past year or so, I’ve posted every day… and there’s been almost a week between this post and my last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was sick, like &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; sick, with one of those 24-hour stomach bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I realized during the thick of it was that the problems I was currently thinking about _before _ I got sick were now relatively meaningless. I had a deadline for my job to meet, I was out of town for a wedding and navigating new faces (which for an introvert is fun but exhausting). All of that mattered very little when I found myself unable to move from my bed to go anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Talk to anyone who has had a kid, or someone who is close to someone who has had a kid and you’ll hear this phrase: &lt;em&gt;parenting is hard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an understandable response. Especially for mothers who are learning how to breastfeed and pump, among so many other new skills. For fathers who are trying to figure out how to nurture in their own way. For support partners. For grandparents who are learning to navigate the dichotomy of unsolicited advice and teaching.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Those things _are _hard. They’re new skills and habits and we have &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; little time in which to learn them well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But parenting itself has proved to be more of a spiritual experience. And like any spiritual experience, it is neither easy or hard. It is &lt;em&gt;rich.&lt;/em&gt; It is _teeming with possibility. _It’s the cross roads of beauty and curiosity. It’s the center of the universe constantly shifting and reminding all the other parts of the universe that they, too, are the center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is creation and construction. Creation can’t be easy, but it also can’t be hard. It is the result of the spark of curiosity. And construction is a step-by-step journey, each step within grasp, but not close enough to grab with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m lying under my covers and it’s warm. It’s snowing outside, lightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of nowhere you’re crying, and I feel this sense of duty to get up, to go calm you, to feed you, to change you. I don’t always, because I’d like to give you space to figure out how to get back to sleep on your own. But there is an instinctual immediate feeling of duty (not obligation). &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Waking up will change. It’s not pleasant now. You usually wake up moaning or sometimes crying for a few minutes before figuring out where you are. Eventually waking up will be pleasant. It is pleasant for me to wake up next to your mom every day, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when you wake up late at night and I hear the crackling of your little voice through the monitor, my reaction is primal. Unlike the feeling I get when I emerge from bed to go to work every morning, I’m ready to rip off the covers and barrel into the room completely naked, without even putting my glasses on, to see what it is you might need. Work is obligation. Being your dad is not work, it’s my duty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter what time it is, how cold it is, or how comfortable I am. I will always be there to figure you out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A number of years ago, I released a video about tea and friendship. In the video, I filmed my friend Grant making tea with an overdubbed conversation about how tea is like friendship because you have to “re-steep” occasionally, bringing out deeper and more complex flavors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But another way that tea is like friendship is that different flavors can be brought out depending on the temperature of the water. In the same way that boiling water brings out the astringent qualities of a good green tea, a particularly aggressive friend might bring out &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; more astringent qualities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Certain people bring out certain “flavors” of my personality, which is why I love having a diverse friend group with many different perspectives and personalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I say that I like you, please know that I am saying we are &lt;em&gt;alike.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, we’re not identical, and perhaps there’s only a tiny cross-section of personality that we share. But if I like you (and it’s mutual), we’ve found a little grassy area for a picnic. We’ve found our topic of conversation, a conversation that we will have to abandon when it’s time to leave, and pick back up again when we reunite.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever gone to a museum for abstract art? And have you ever wondered what you’re looking at? Why it sells?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a classic meme of someone looking at a big white frame that an artist left intentionally blank, and it has a price tag of $1000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s also the case of abstract math. This is what teachers mean when they teach things like 7-2, without any context or real world application.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;What it makes us realize is that these numbers are symbols, just like art pieces, that encourage the _participant _to determine meaning. The symbol 7 only means seven whole units because we decided it would. The white frame only represents heaven because we decided it did.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Row Your Boat A Koan</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Row row row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me that this children’s rhyme might be a Zen koan (a puzzle with no answer). Rowing is an active movement, a choice. And we do it merrily, to enjoy life and pay no attention to suffering. But a stream carries us, whether we want it to or not. We can’t choose what shows up on the shores nearby. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mary, Mary, quite contrary, how does your garden grow?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A garden and a gym are both opportunities for growth. In a gym, it’s the gym-goers duty to lift heavier or run faster/farther than they did the week before. In a garden, it’s a plant’s job to grow, and it’s the gardener’s job to create the conditions necessary for that growth to occur.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So it’s quite contrary how gardens grow. They don’t. The plants grow, but only as a function of the attention of the gardener to details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had many recurring nightmares in my life, but none have been quite as prevalent as the one where I’m underprepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a few forms. Sometimes I’ve forgotten that there’s a class I signed up for, never went to, and now I have to take the exam. Other times, I have a gig and I forget some equipment and while I’m trying to get things together people are leaving. Or I’m in front of a class without a lesson plan. So many different scenarios for the same dream.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;What does it mean? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know, but it’s probably that, like many of us, I have low-grade anxiety about being on time, being prepared and coming off as professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth is, we’re all a mess inside. I don’t mean that in a bad way, and there’s nothing to fix. But we play the role of the person who has it together simply because that’s what we need to project. It’s logical, practical, and stressful in a permeating way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pre Therapy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the waiting room of my therapist’s office, there’s a huge TV screen that shows a live feed of the view from the International Space Station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing: because her office is filled with other therapists, everyone has a white noise machine outside of their room to make sure nothing from the session is heard outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So most times while I’m waiting for her, I’m watching the world from space and drowning in a sea of ambient white noise. There is no better way to start therapy. In fact, the pre-therapy is a kind of therapy in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dont Stress About Who You Are</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2020-01-03-dont-stress-about-who-you-are/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can change your pen, but you’ll still have the same handwriting. Just like with chronic disease, you never really get rid of _anything – _ you just learn to manage it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That might be disheartening, but it’s actually necessary. If the goal of childhood is to end up with some idea of who you are, it might sound like a stressful task. Actually, figuring out who you are doesn’t require adding anything new to your life. No new systems, new diets, new fitness regimens. It requires losing something, which is the idea of &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It requires losing something, which is the idea of &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you ask, no, I haven’t done this, and I don’t know of anyone that has. I’ve never met anyone whom I would consider enlightened. We’re all just _managing _the condition we call life, a mix of pain and joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever want to know who you are, ask yourself a few times. The answer might surprise you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did this the other night as a meditation. At first, I started thinking that maybe I was my name. But that isn’t right, my name was given to me. It’s not who I really am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I my job? No, I’ve changed jobs many times and will again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I a collection of irrelevant molecules? Perhaps. But I still don’t think that is “I.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then suddenly it hit me. No, not some kind of answer that I could boil down into a memorable quote. But something did hit me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every person who has ever explored the question of who they are has returned with the same answer, even though they may articulate it differently, and even though they disagree about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we ask ourselves who we are, we don’t get a real answer. Instead, we realize that when &lt;em&gt;all of us&lt;/em&gt; are asking who we are collectively, it’s rather obvious who we are. Laughable, even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s as if we’re the collective eyes of existence (along with everything else). As if we are the universe becoming aware of itself. One eye closes at the end of a person’s life, and a new eye opens on a newborn’s face somewhere else in the world. It continues. No difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So don’t stress about figuring out who you are. There’s nothing to figure. And managing that quandary is our life’s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s a nice trick, but it’s not _real _magic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I get this comment, I agree. And it makes me wonder, then, what &lt;em&gt;real magic&lt;/em&gt; looks like, and what this person is expecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose it’s the unexplained phenomena in our lives… but is it “real” simply because it lacks an explanation? If that’s the case, then my tricks &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; real magic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Whether magic is real or not depends on the participant. When the universe manipulates itself it’s very much like when I manipulate a deck of cards in order to deceive someone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything depends on deception.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow is New Years Day, but only because we call it that, only because we decided that this is when the “new year” would begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these words like time and years are just constructs.You can have a “new year” anytime you’d like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why a new year’s resolution can be functional is not because of the clocks changing from 2019 to 2020, but because in this two-week lull of winter break, everything is partially shut down. Work, school, and other activities are usually off. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It’s the best time to &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; your new habits, &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the new year begins. Put together your fitness or nutrition plan. Start to learn the motions, start to cook small things at home. When the new year arrives, the habit will already be there in a small way and it can grow.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently gotten back into newsletters. Not ones from companies, but ones from actual people (currently, I’m enjoying Austin Kleon’s, which includes 10 interesting things to check out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I love about these newsletters is that I’ve already given permission to the creators. I’ve already enrolled in a list, and I actually look forward to the newsletter every week. Compare this to my RSS or Facebook or Twitter feed, which basically does exactly what the word “feed” entails: it feeds me… total crap. Since we literally scroll through our feeds searching for gems amongst a sea of shit, the headlines and 160 character tweets have to be eyeball-grabbing. So we have our eyeballs grabbed and released over and over until something of value appears or until we get tired and move on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The newsletters I subscribe to are illustrious, well-designed, and full of interesting content. It might make sense to scale down my intake to &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; newsletters, only returning to the land of social media every week or so.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Costumes Vs Outfits</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently discovered that the men’s suit was modeled off of the type of outfit that military generals wear. It got me wondering… what’s the difference between an outfit and a costume?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An outfit is also more personal in some ways, but then again a costume is very personal too. If you asked me and I had no resources, I’d say that the distinction is a costume is make believe, and an outfit is based in reality. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But then I’d wonder about make believe vs. reality. Do we “play” the people that show up to do our jobs? Do we “play” being a good Samaritan? Do we “play” someone who is politically woke or well-informed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you answered yes to any of the above (or any of the unlisted ones), then your outfits are occasionally costumes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or…you who work in theater or a similar craft and literally, your costumes are outfits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, the line is blurry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite questions to ask people (especially kids) when they see a movie adaptation of a book…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you read the book after having seen the movie, do you visualize the actors from the movie playing their characters in your mind?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve seen the Harry Potter movies and you’ve also read the books, does Daniel Radcliffe appear in your mind instead of the young wizard boy you envisioned when you first read the series years ago?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;For one of my favorites, A Wrinkle in Time, nothing could ever replace the characters that I created in my mind on my first read through the book. Not the 2007 straight to DVD budget movie, and not the Ava Duvernay version from last year. Perhaps the world that Madleine L’engle was too good. Or perhaps the movies that the Harry Potter production team produced were too good, so that I now think of Emma Watson instead of my true version of Hermione.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, it’s something to consider. Childhood beloved novels are important, and the visions we create while reading them as children may be important to preserve. They’ll still make movies, no question… but we may choose not to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Concert Alone</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I rarely go to live events on my own. Rarely do I see concerts by myself, or movies, or plays. It just feels so lonely. But when I do go alone to these kinds of events, I get a very special feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I see a movie or concert alone, and I walk out of the theater… there’s no one to talk to. No one to reflect on the experience with. Therefore, I’m left with my own thoughts and &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The first time it happened, I couldn’t decide whether or not I liked what I had just seen (Austrian guitarist Fennesz). That usually doesn’t happen – I have some idea usually of how I liked a performance. It made me think that perhaps there have been other performance I wasn’t sure about, but that I just agreed with the opinion of whomever I was with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you really want to experience what it’s like to tune into yourself and your thoughts about art, try the experience without other people giving you inputs. It might change the way you process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Time For Sleep</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s a trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I give up 8 hours in my 24 hour day in order to get reenergized and recovered. It was fashionable when I was a baby to trade a lot of time for it, because I needed to recover often. But when I was a teen, I &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; I didn’t need to recover as much and so spent less time on to sleep… until I crashed and burned mid-week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;As a college student, my days were often unpredictable. The 8 hours of sleep per day would come, but maybe in chunks, or maybe in the complete opposite part fo the day where other people sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, I pay my dues. I trade the right amount and quality of time (at night, when nothing is really happening and everyone else is asleep) for energy and present mind during the day. I like it that way, and maybe this is a symptom of being in my mid-30s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We trade time for sleep, but eventually when we rob ourselves of sleep, sleep robs us of our time..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting a child to bed is one of the most fascinating experiences of parenthood so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve never thought about where one actually &lt;em&gt;goes&lt;/em&gt; when they go to sleep, not since I was a child. But my son will cry and whimper and cling when I put him down until, all of a sudden, sleep has whisked him away to its magical land of dreams and replenishment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It’s almost as if there’s a sleep train, and you have to be at the station (bed) on time in order to catch it. Those times where we end up putting him down too late or too early means he doesn’t catch the train with as much ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But where does the train go for hours? What journeys does he take? Are they like mine? I guess I’ll never know since I barely know where &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it’s fun to wonder.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bowing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the start and end of Zazen, it is customary to bow. I always thought this bowing was to the buddha, but when I learned more about Buddhism realized that the Buddha himself advised not to admire the Buddha too much, and that we are all buddhas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So who are we bowing to? In a hall of practitioners, you’d bow to your neighbor on the left and right. I’ve never practiced in such a hall, but when I do zazen solo, I bow in order to give gratitude. To everything and everyone. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It sounds fluffy, but it’s more centering than it appears to be at first. When I bow, in trying to think about what I’m grateful for, I end up cycling through a list of people, then large groups of people, until I realize that, really, I’m grateful for _everyone _and every piece of the puzzle. It’s too overwhelming a feeling to think about for too long. A bow is just long enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also think of it was “boh-ing” – like the type of bow you put on a present. We start and end with a “bow” to tie the experience up in spiritual gift wrap.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks is a unit of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the distance between therapy sessions, between check-ins, between meetings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It used to be a week, back in the good old days. But now I need a full two to really understand what I’m dealing with and where I’m at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weekend in the middle, the half way point, is a tiny little compass pointing us to the light at the end.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Six Breaths Per Minute</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was surprised the first time I heard that the optimal number of breaths per minute for a human is about &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24380741&#34;&gt;six&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it: sit down somewhere comfortable and try to take six breaths (in and out is one breath). Make each one last about 10 seconds. No need to time it perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first tried this activity, I pictured my breath going up a flight of stairs and back down. Or perhaps taking an elevator to the top floor, and then back down to the basement. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The towel hanger on the back of the bathroom door fell off this morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the third piece of the bathroom to break in the last week or so. First the knob on the shower handle, then then stopper lever on the faucet, and now this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This house is falling apart,&lt;/em&gt; I thought to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, another thought: &lt;em&gt;This house is always falling apart. And it’s always being repaired. And through it all, it stays calm… so why can’t I?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a house is like a mountain. Constantly in flux, but present throughout. It’s nature that changes a mountain, the siding on the house… but it’s &lt;em&gt;humans&lt;/em&gt; who break and repair the inside of the house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then the voice reminds me that &lt;em&gt;humans are part of nature too&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I feel infinitely better about the towel hanger all of a sudden.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We hosted a dinner a while back and made the entire meal ourselves. We had a romantic experience in the kitchen, tossing ingredients, dancing to music, tasting, and smelling. When we saw the reaction to the food we’d made, it was a nice cap to the end of a great experience from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joy of a potluck is that every person contributing gets to have this experience. Every person gets the experience and journey of cooking a dish for others, and watching their reactions. And every person gets to consume another person’s creation, in what becomes a very intimate exchange.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was young, my parents convinced me that I should fast for at least one of the days of Ramadan. The challenge was a good one, and I grew as a result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at the end of the fast, when all I wanted was a Big Mac, my mom gave me a date. I remember thinking it was gross, and then devouring my Big Mac. I never tried dates again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Until I tried to make a vegan dessert recently and used dates as both a sweetener and a gooey substance to make the crust of the fake cheesecake I was putting together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up eating a plain date as I was cooking (I was getting hungry). The sweetness blew me away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that I had been eating processed sugar for so long that I had forgotten what it was like to be knocked on your feet by a sweet, natural treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a bit like listening to a CD after years of hearing compressed music.The highs and lows were more noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, with the date, the flavor profile and the sweetness was noticeable. When I eat something like a shock tart, I just numb out. The experience is good in that it’s overwhelming. A hurricane when all you need is a gentle rainfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subtly and beauty are hidden in the sweetness of natural foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I got myself a cute bento box and started making cute lunches to put inside of it. The first time I made a salad in this thing with red cabbage, greens, and berries, I was stunned at how beautiful the whole thing looked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I hope you’re posting these,” my wife told me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And truth be told, that was my first notion as well. I like to take pictures of things that are pretty or fascinating, and I like to post these things online. But lately I’ve been thinking about how I can cut down on social media use, and my new criteria is that I will &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ziahassan.com/daily/the-up-and-downsides-to-social-media/&#34;&gt;only post things of value&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Value is of course determined by the reader, but if I feel like I’m posting something that provides no value to anyone, I’ll refrain. If I’d posted my bento recipe, or perhaps my thoughts on nutrition, or perhaps my daily habits… those things might help someone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a pic of my lunch on its own? It only helps me convey to people how healthy I think I am (and perhaps remind some of them of how healthy they are not).It’s not useful for anyone but me, in other words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so the pics of my lunch will stay on my phone until they might provide value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took my son to a restaurant in Tucson the other night. As the food was being prepared, a jazz band loaded up their gear in front of us and began to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My son, who has always had a love of music, became completely entranced with the performance. He sat on the cough in the restaurant and watched in awe. The band members of course were more than happy to make funny faces and smiles at him from the stage. Then, he started to dance to the music. The drummer even let him come up on stage and hit the drums with his sticks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;While the whole thing was super adorable, I realized that this occasion marked the first time that my son was moved by jazz. Not only had he stumbled upon a new genre, but he also got to experience live music for the first time (other than a gig of mine he attended close to when he was born). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt a little envious. How amazing it must be to be moved by jazz for the first time. To hear the fluidity of the notes and the jangly and unpredictable rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how many other firsts will he get to experience in his life? His first rollercoaster, first rock concert, first sleepover, first buffet…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how many of these have become routine for me? Again, I learn from him: if we’re moved the first time, we can be always be moved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got back from the club, right before bed, Dezi noticed the full moon. We stood outside, his mother, him and I, just watching and letting the space rock do its incredible work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t matter how many times I’ve seen the moon. Every time is like the first.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I take time to think about what I wear much more than I used to. Different clothes appeal to different situations. For instance, I now wear a vest and bowties in certain situations, or a casual sweater in another. Style has become more fascinating to me in my 30s for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one peculiar habit I have is wearing hoodies. I wear them all the time, no matter the time of year. And the ones that I end up with are either bought off the rack because they looked cool and interesting, other ones were inherited or “borrowed” from my wife.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But one peculiar habit I have is wearing hoodies. I wear them all the time, no matter the time of year. And the ones that I end up with are either bought off the rack because they looked cool and interesting, other ones were inherited or “borrowed” from my wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m currently wearing a hoodie from Crisis Text Line (a number to text when you feel depressed or suicidal). I’ve never volunteered there, but my wife has. I also have a beautiful Burgundy hoodie that says “wild cats” on it. Apparently, this is a reference to High School Musical, but I didn’t know that when I bought it – I just knew it was he heaviest sweatshirt on the rack. Or another shirt to promote the sports team the Raiders. It’s baby blue, and I bought it at Giant on a cold day (I had forgotten to wear a jacket). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my hoodies don’t represent me. I like this. It’s much better than wearing an identity, like those who put political bumper stickers on their car, or tongue-in-cheek shirts or whatever it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also a constant reminder that the way we present ourselves to the world doesn’t always align to who we really are underneath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been much for “going on a walk.” The idea seemed to trivial to me when I was young. My parents would go on a walk in loops around our neighborhood, and while I’d join them sometimes, I just &lt;em&gt;didn’t get it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it just wasn’t presented to me properly. “Going for a walk” is uninspiring, but &lt;em&gt;wandering&lt;/em&gt; is absolutely enlightening. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few days, I’ve spent my mornings with my son wandering around, discovering and exploring whatever I can find with him. I return home sweaty and out of breath, getting all the same cardio benefits that I would from a walk, but with other, more fascinating gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like, discovering a pond that has koi fish and a turtle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or a little meditation garden, with fountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or a little path with a bridge nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are really the gifts that the exploration gives me. The cardiovascular exercise is of course beneficial too. But if my walks were just about raising my heart rate, I’d stop doing them sooner than later.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I went to a lecture yesterday on what it means to be to your true authentic self. It was interesting, but nothing said taught me more than what my son teaches me when I spend time with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever hear the phrase “feel like a child again!” It’s usually supposed to mean to feel careless, free, and exploratory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what Dezi teaches me is that being a child means to be the truest version of yourself. My child is direct, states his needs, knows when he’s done eating or sleeping, and is entranced by almost anything (especially nature). We were all like this once. Then we started to follow rules, become complacent, and adhere to the status quo. Not all of us, and not in every way, but it happened.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So to be a kid again is not just acting in an immature way, or even in a playful way. It is returning to the very nature of who you are and what it means to live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of my friends have told me that my wedding was one of the most fun events they’ve been to. What was our secret, they ask?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venue we picked was gorgeous, with incredible decorations and atmosphere. We had an indoor area for eating and dancing, and an outdoor area for the ceremony. The location was perfect: Minneapolis in June, on a picture perfect day. And the ceremony itself was unique, combining wedding traditions from both Jewish and Indian/Muslim cultures. All of these variables contributed to the overall success of the wedding. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But the magic, the part that I believe took it to a new level, was the guest list. We had so many guests from both families. We got to watch them intermingle and get to know each other, like little facets of our own personalities intermingling when we first met. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do it right, your wedding guests from different sides of the family will fall in love with each other the way you did with your fiancee. It’s not about the quantity of the guests, but the quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of a meditation session, a monk or leader generally rings a bell. It’s been said that this is the only time that you’ve actually meditated, when the bell is rung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because you’ve spent the last however many minutes in a cycle of mind redirection, of your mind wandering and of bringing it back to the present moment. It’s a self-regulated exercise for everyone in the room. Each person, at any point in the meditation is either coming back to the present (waking up) or getting lost in thought (sleeping). Until, at the very end of the session…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The bell rings. And every single person in the room experiences waking up together. In the same way that shavasana (sleep pose in Yoga) brings the results of your practice into being, so too does the bell at the end of zazen. And, for that matter, so does the bell that literally wakes you in the morning, or the one that signals you to change classes in high school. (How many times have you fallen asleep in class until the bell rings?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I own a singing bowl to produce pure sound, I use the Insight Timer app on most days. It seems to have the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Your Brain The Inbox</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my favorite productivity framework, GTD, David Allen talks about the inbox as a place to collect and capture ideas. You capture and collect in the inbox without giving anything extra thoughts, and then you process later. The idea is that you can get your ideas out quickly and really figure out what to do with them at a different time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meditation is like this too. If our brain is an inbox, then it collects thoughts and ideas all day. Most of the time, the analysis and processing of those thoughts happen right as the thought occurs. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But what if we took the GTD approach to these thoughts? A thought occurs, seemingly out of nowhere, and instead of processing or sorting it, we leave it be. Then later we come back to figure out where the thought will fit in our mental puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time and space can help us make better decisions than we would if we were in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The First Question The Doctor Asks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Can you tell me about your diet and exercise?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s one of the first questions the doctor usually asks. About 3 years ago, this was the first question I was asked at my physical. I wasn’t quite sure how to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Uh. I could do better, I guess,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, I hadn’t even thought about it. Fitness was just whatever my daily activity was based on my job and my hobbies. Diet was just whatever restaurant or fast food joint happened to appear. For most of my 20’s, that was the food court at the bottom of my office building. My diet and fitness weren’t planned. They were simply a matter of convenience. And that convenience had evolved into some health issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I realized something profound that day: diet and fitness need to be intentional and designed, if you care about your health. It doesn’t mean you need to go on a full out extreme diet. Or that you need to spend hours in the gym. Even if your diet plan is to eat mostly whole foods, and your fitness is a 5 min walk every week, that’s still a plan. And even the smallest plans can grow.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Moderation Vs Indulgence</title>

&lt;p&gt;Oscar Wilde once said “everything should be consumed in moderation, including moderation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped and thought about this quote the first time I heard it. I interpreted the message as it’s important to indulge occasionally, that we aren’t really living unless we’re indulging. And that led to another thought, what specifically is an indulgence? And for that matter, what specifically is moderation?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And that led to another thought, what specifically is an indulgence? And for that matter, what specifically is moderation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the dictionary isn’t _alway__s _useful, it can be helpful some of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderation is defined as the avoidance of excess or extremes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indulgence is defined as allowing one’s self to enjoy pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that these ideas are not mutually exclusive. In fact, one can practice moderation while indulging. If a person can’t allow themselves to enjoy pleasure without going to extremes, then they may need to seek therapy for addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can indulge, allow ourselves to enjoy the pleasure, of anything… even of those things that we feel are consumed in moderation, then we never &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to go to extremes and drop moderation entirely. Perhaps Wilde assumed that moderation means having so much control over consumption that pleasure is stifled. But I disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, every day, you ate a hamburger, French fries, and milkshake, you might think of this an indulgence. You might think that moderation means eating a green salad on most days and saving the burger for the weekend. But I think it’s more nuanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps moderation means slowing down the burgers, yes. But indulgence could mean learning to savor the flavor profile of a _really _good green salad. One could indulge deeply in something that isn’t extreme, and perhaps the same could go for &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; in a person’s life. Family, job, water with fruit in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s indulge every day, without going to extremes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ignoring Advice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I give and get advice all the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the giving part: these days, I’m a bit more reserved. I scour more than most, I am a seeker. I’m also a messenger when I find a useful technique or a piece of art. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I give less these days because I know what it’s like to get advice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes someone will say something to me, some advice or recommendation that is perfectly appropriate for their life experience but incompatible with mine. It causes cognitive dissonance, especially when it comes from someone I respect. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But that’s all part of what my therapist describes as tuning into yourself. Despite the fact that I create things from my imagination on a nearly daily basis, I have a hard time accepting that I could have a different perspective than my beloved family and friends. This is further by compounded by the group think that seems to happen over social media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I give less. Because the appropriate advice for me is not necessarily the appropriate advice for another. And it’s very hard to tell. I once recommended a guitar to a musician who played similar music to me. Much to my surprise, they hated the guitar, opting for one that I would’ve never selected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because you’re like someone else, doesn’t mean that your life values and rules are appropriate for them, even if they’re looking for life values and rules (as many people do). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s because life values can only be realized by tuning into one’s self and maybe, just maybe, ignoring everything else for a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I invited a friend of mine over to meet my son. This friend voiced their concern that they’re not “good with kids.” They don’t know what to say, it’s always awkward, they told me. Coincidentally, this was the same week that SNL posted its funny &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsEsgp3H7CU&#34;&gt;Duolingo for kids&lt;/a&gt; sketch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the sketch is funny, it does identify an interesting problem. As parents, we know what to say to our kids to keep them organized, to hear about their feelings, to communicate with them. And when we meet another adult, we can make small talk about the weather and work. But what about meeting a kid that you don’t know? What is the kid version of small talk? The adult version doesn’t seem to work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I can’t say for sure, but I do have a go-to method when you need to make “small talk” with a kid… and that is, &lt;em&gt;don’t talk&lt;/em&gt;. Instead, simply become curious about what they are curious about. It might take some questioning to figure out what that is, and it’s possible that they may not even want to talk to you at all… but instead of asking the typical questions (&lt;em&gt;how’s school?)&lt;/em&gt; you can ask to see their favorite toy, or ask them about the paperclip they’re bending out of shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And come to think of it, it’s a great way to engage with anyone. Small talk for adults, after all, is just filler. Instead of asking “what do you do?” Try asking “what are you curious about right now?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation might go in a completely beautiful and expected direction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Brene Brown has said that our ability to be vulnerable unblocks us, and heals our wounds. The idea is that if we are open with each other, if we can feel safe and shameless, we can be more productive in our personal and professional relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s an underlying current to vulnerability that is subtle at first: the idea of vulnerability implies that every single person experiences self-doubt and to some degree, is insecure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Vulnerability, then, could be the acknowledgment of this very common feature of the human experience. That we are all unsure, trying to make sense of a sea of uncertainty. And if we simply recognize this as a shared experience, we’d all improve the quality of our life here in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Names</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-12-01-using-names/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most memorable themes from teacher training was the focus on using names. At most corporate events I’ve attended in the last decade or so, name tags were given out, but not actually honored (as in, no one used them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But during our 3-week summer institute, we all explored our names, wrote about our names, and made the effort to use everyone’s name when speaking to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first week of my first teaching job, my mentor’s biggest note for me was that I needed to use names more. I soon started using names so much that it felt I was &lt;em&gt;overusing&lt;/em&gt; names. Turns out I wasn’t. The response from the students was almost immediate. They were slightly, but noticeably, more attentive than before I started using their names more often.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Even though a name is just something our parents made up to label us at birth, it becomes wired to us, in a natural way, like our shadow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when we use other people’s names, we evoke that primal sense of &lt;em&gt;self&lt;/em&gt; in the other. It’s powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun experiment to try: go into a room alone, say your name aloud over and over. Feel the need to respond at the same time you’re calling. It’s a unique feeling that captures the essence of what it means to have a name.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Looking Seeing And Observing</title>

&lt;p&gt;Seeing is the act of processing visual information. Seeing isn’t judging. It’s natural for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking is a type of seeking. When we look for things, we’re filtering out information to find exactly what we need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observing is a type of information gathering. We observe to collect data for later analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different types of eye functions for different situations. You need to see when you’re driving. You need to look when you’re at the grocery store. And you need to observe when you’re solving complex problems, like how to get your kid to get to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Which one do you do the most of the time? What’s your balance like? And how can you use these distinctions to optimize functionality?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Your Own Rules</title>

&lt;p&gt;One of the very first pieces of advice that I remember receiving was &lt;em&gt;live by your own rules.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds like a good idea. After all, if you don’t live by your own rules, you’re living under the rules of someone else, which can be problematic for a number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the advice should have been: figure out &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;you will decide&lt;/em&gt; on your own personal rules. Before you can follow your own rules, you have to have them to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I do. I collect, in a digital notebook, all of the turning points in my life. Major conflicts, the end of struggles. Joyous occasions, whatever it might be… and then I figure out, from those big events, what my values are, and what my rules should be. I add a new rule to the list, and maybe remove an old one that no longer resonates. It’s almost like those huge moments are like little marks on a map, and I’m writing the field guide.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I write this blog out of my own curiosity, out of a need to document ideas and thoughts. A need to hit publish and ship work every single day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve read my writing, thanks for hearing me out. I hope I am able to connect with you on occasion, to hear your ideas and thoughts. I want to be influenced and helped by your ideas, in the same way that I hope my ideas are helpful and influential to you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;We live in &lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt; an amazing time. There are no gatekeepers that say we can’t be poets, writers, musicians, philosophers. We get to decide who we are, and what type of art speaks to us most. We get to put our work out for our audience and no one can deny us that right. It hasn’t always been that way, and so I am thankful to live in the world of today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if people have always felt that way about the present. Grateful to live in it, instead of the past, which can only be visited in dreams anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was obsessed with movies as a kid, but not really with the cinematics. I was obsessed with the editing. The cuts, the fades, the title credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much so that I would sometimes escape by imagining my life as a movie that I was directing. Real life scenarios became scenes and I imagined how the cuts would look, and what music I would select to accompany these scenes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Years later, I realize this was a bit of intuitive mindfulness training. To see life as an external narrative, as the viewer or director, means that we acknowledge our separation from the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It matters. Regardless of how much we get swept up in the romance of a story, regardless of the fact that we are the director and producer of our own story… we are, first and foremost, the audience.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Divide Between Science And Mindfulness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The scientific method is a useful tool to explain cause and effect. We can look at a problem, take a guess, run some tests, come up with an explanation and recommend a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people, myself included, rely on the scientific method (through research and studies) to make decisions and choices. What food should I eat? How should I work out? All of these choices could be made through examining the research conducted using the scientific method.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But sometimes we take our reliance on the scientific mindset too far. Take the act of mindful meditation. There are scientific benefits to mediation, but that’s not that I’m talking about. I’m talking about the &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; of mindfulness. In that moment of pure clarity, there’s no need to explain anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the face of meditation, the scientific method becomes utterly useless. Science is a finger pointing to the moon; mindfulness is the moon itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a social media challenge where you post a picture of yourself from a decade ago, followed by one of you now. I think it’s mostly used as a vanity thing, so that people feel that they’re better off then they were. I haven’t posted one, but reflecting on on the me of a decade ago is a useful exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, you can immediately see what the big themes of my life have been when you look at the last 10 years: becoming a teacher, a father, getting married, taking more responsibility for health and wealth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Those are the things that I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; now. But as for those things I don’t do anymore…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t binge watch TV or movies anymore. I lived in fantastical worlds for most of my childhood; in adulthood, I felt that it’s time to start living in the present moment. This need was spurred by working with and being around children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t obsess over everything anymore. Don’t get me wrong, I still obsess over lots of things, just at a slower rate than a decade ago. I’ve become a little more aware of what’s really worth obsessing over and what isn’t. I’ve also learned that the answer to this question varies depending on who you’re talking to… and I’ve learned to respect that principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t post as much on social media. Instagram stories and this blog being the exceptions, I’ve slowed down a lot of my social media use. I really enjoy using a public medium like Instagram stories coupled with a semi-private blog where I can write things that an audience will find (rather than the other way around).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t yuck people’s yums anymore; that is, I’m not as elitist as I was in my 20’s. I’ve realized that my opinion on music, movies, art, whatever… is no more valuable than anyone else’s. Another principle that must be respected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe most most importantly, I don’t believe I can change anyone’s behavior. Oh, I’ll still try in my worst moments. But deep down, I know it isn’t possible, and never was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another alternative meditation technique is as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter the meditation room, close the door, and don’t open it again for the next 20 minutes. You must stay in this space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But physically staying in a space is somewhat easy. We could read or watch TV in the same room for hours and hours. Staying inside of a space metaphysically is the hard part.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Or perhaps I’ve traveled into the future and I’m experiencing what Thanksgiving dinner will be like (in my imagination).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we stay in a room, both physically and spiritually, the room becomes the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Shopping Mall Nothing To Buy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ve got nothing to do, nothing to buy, nowhere to go. It’s just you and an open afternoon and the skies look stormy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you head to the mall because you figure that it’ll be slow around this time of day and you can order a coffee and write while you watch people. It’s the mall you’ve been going to since you were a kid and so much has changed. The video game store is now a swim apparel store. The book store that used to be there, with all of its comic books and mad libs, is now a high end tea store. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But you notice something peculiar: all of the stores are like little sets for some improvised play. There’s an entire experienced designed around each brand, meticulously matched with the way the brand wants to make you feel. When you visit the mall, it’s like watching and engaging with a few short works of theater. Even down to the lighting, and the smell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how you know you’re shopping for entertainment. It’s the same with the bar or the fancy restaurant. No need to feel sinful; these experiences &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; worth money, because they are highly crafted stories.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve become fascinated lately with meditation techniques that go beyond just sitting and breathing. It turns out you can meditate basically anywhere, even while you’re driving. In fact, it’s particularly _potent _to meditate while driving. This is because meditation is the process of becoming aware, rather than dozing off. What better place to become aware than on the road? Most of the time we spend driving is spent on other thoughts. Like being in the shower, it provides a very easy opportunity for mindfulness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Another one: keep your phone far away and have a meal with someone. When the twitches to pick it up intensify, resist the urge. Come back to the present moment, the conversation, the wholesome meal. Each time you return, you awaken.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Up And Downsides To Social Media</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone has a microphone. Everyone has a platform. Now, with the power of a Facebook or Twitter or Instagram account, _anyone _can write their thoughts and have an immediate audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upsides are what we’ve been talking about over the last decade: now, no voice gets left out. No one is barred by gatekeepers. For most intents and purposes, gatekeepers don’t even exist anymore, or if they do, they’re simply watching to see who’s doing the groundwork on their own before they make their picks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For most intents and purposes, gatekeepers don’t even exist anymore, or if they do, they’re simply watching to see who’s doing the groundwork on their own before they make their picks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside is that what most people post is of little value to everyone else. Perhaps I’ll see a post where someone is wishing their loved one a happy birthday. But if I don’t know that person, the post isn’t very useful to me. It’s useful to the person that posted it though, because now they get the status that comes with posting about having friends. The question we must ask ourselves, in today’s social media landscape is… &lt;em&gt;to whom are we speaking?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people go off on rants, who are they ranting at? Which unindentified facebook friend is their audience? And if I’m not the intended audience, why am I even reading their post? For all of its personalization algorithms, Facebook can’t really serve me the most useful things; only the things that I will be most drawn to… and those certainly aren’t the same category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Posts are either useful for the audience or they are useful for the poster. If we instilled a new norm, which is that we can now _only _post something that is useful for everyone, we might find that the online world suddenly has less contempt, less displays of status, less clutter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we’ll be better for it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Open To Being Wrong</title>

&lt;p&gt;Most people get a thrill out of being &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;. That is, if they can prove their point well enough that another person is persuaded, they feel good about themselves. Their viewpoints become validated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’d like to meet more people who are open to being wrong. I’m not talking about the mere admittance that one &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be wrong, but that they actively seek out ways to discredit their own views, as counter-intuitive as the idea sounds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I think those who engage in this sort of mental reconstruction are smarter than most. They understand there’s a line between intellect and tribalism. That beliefs aren’t really based on logic and reason. That most beliefs are based on emotion. An in fact, the stronger one clings to their beliefs in the face of contrary evidence, the more likely that their belief was based on emotion to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn’t &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; to use emotion to create beliefs. We all do it. But when we create a belief that is impervious to any contrary evidence, we’ve backed ourselves into a corner. A life that was once dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge becomes a fortress, closed off and shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not even the light gets in.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>When To See A Therapist</title>

&lt;p&gt;I had lunch with a friend recently and mentioned that I was seeing a therapist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A therapist? Why? Are you depressed?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, I didn’t decide to see a therapist because I was depressed. It was because we just had a child. I wanted to know my own mind so I could be the most effective parent possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every couple weeks, my therapist and I meet to examine my life: my biases, my quirks, my challenges, and my wins. My anxiety was already declining when I began seeing her and I’ve never been depressed (other than some acute episodes). In examining my life, I get to uncover some really important features of my mind that I didn’t know about before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In examining my life, I get to uncover some really important features of my mind that I didn’t know about before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, my need to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ziahassan.com/daily/how-to-be-sad/&#34;&gt;skip sadness&lt;/a&gt; and go directly to anger. Becoming aware of this lifelong feature empowered me to decide to try a different way of thinking. I realized that our thinking patterns are like dirt paths. If you’re walking in a field and see a dirt path, chances are you’ll walk on it just for a sense of direction. The same goes with our mind: if we have an established thought process, it’s the easiest and only known route to take, so we take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that path was created by our minds to begin with. There are &lt;em&gt;infinite&lt;/em&gt; paths to take. Therapy can help us see that, which creates a new world of possibility within us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw an Instagram post that said seeing a therapist when you’re depressed should be the same as seeing a doctor when you have the flu. I don’t see it this way. I see the therapist as I see a fitness coach. They watch your form, they give you feedback, and then it’s on you to practice and make it happen. Preventative instead of reactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how we change the stigma. Not by looking at our mental health the way we look at a broken arm. But by looking at it as practice for healthy interpersonal and intrapersonal relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is purely anecdotal, but I see it all the time: those who switch lines furiously on the highway are also &lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt; at using their signal. Yet, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.his.com/~pete/asa.pdf&#34;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that switching lanes frequently doesn’t take many minutes off of our trip. We’ll still get to our destination at about the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes me think of the book Faster Smarter Better by Charles Duhigg, the author tells us that having autonomy can make us feel like we’re in charge, and therefore more motivated to do a task.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if we want to work out more, we can choose which exercises to do, and that will motivate us more. It won’t help us get our workouts done faster necessarily, but it will at least help in wanting to do them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with the traffic scenario, there’s no need for increasing motivation to drive. If we need to be somewhere far away, it’s necessary to drive. The agency we have over which lane to be in makes us feel in control, and therefore better about our commute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s no functional reason to switch lanes aggressively. It’s just another story we tell ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sleeping Through The Noise</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The barrier between sleep and awake is both fragile and strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can sleep through a storm outside, but if the furnace makes any kind of weird buzz, I’m awake instantly. Even a non-intrusive alarm ringtone pierces the veil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep has always been rather mysterious to me. Where do we go when we’ve gone to sleep? How can time seem to pass so quickly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became determined, when I was 5, to catch myself falling asleep. Of course, I was never successful, but isn’t it kind of strange that it’s impassible to notice the moment we fall asleep, no matter how hard we try?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it’s death, simulated every night. Which is another mysterious event that we can’t quite catch. Perhaps every time we fall asleep (even the word fall communicates the instinctive way we tumble into dreams), we are playing with the boundaries of consciousness and unconscious, of darkness and light, of death and life.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Do You Really Think</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It takes some effort to figure out what we really think. Most of the time, we tell ourselves stories in order to make sense of our world. For instance, if I give a public talk or training (something I do almost daily), and the audience is lukewarm or distracted, I might start to tell myself a story. Like, the room is too warm. Or, it’s after lunch which explains the sleepiness. Whether or not the stories are true are a different thing altogether. Most of the time I can never verify.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Or, it’s after lunch which explains the sleepiness. Whether or not the stories are true are a different thing altogether. Most of the time I can never verify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided, one day, to track how many stories I told myself. Every time I started telling myself a story about a family I saw at the mall, or about the neighbors, or about a driver on the road… I noted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiment was eye-opening. Turns out I tell myself stories almost constantly. I tell myself a lot of stories about drivers on the road, and the reasons for their terrible driving (usually, the story is that they’re just an asshole, and have always been an asshole). I tell myself stories about the servers at restaurants who don’t get to my table quickly enough (they’re lazy and the restaurant is poorly managed). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only do I tell myself these stories, but I internalize them. If I were to say these stories out loud, someone close to me could challenge their validity: “are you sure the server is lazy, or could it be that this restaurant is understaffed and they’re doing their best?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s dangerous to believe the stories we tell ourselves. These are the stories that create our world view and affect our behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And most importantly, these stories are pure entertainment. They might make us feel better, if that’s our goal, but they’re theater of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do we actually think? What happens when we filter stories out of our beliefs? We’re left with nothing but what’s in front of us, happening right here and now. We’re left with a temporary frustration or joy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s kind of scary to relieve ourselves from the grasp of our stories. But liberating, too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spontaneity And Routine</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Your options get narrow as you get old,” my friend told me. “There’s just less you’re able to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Or maybe it’s just that most people feel forced to make certain choices when they have kids or get married. Maybe the options are still the same and we’re still in control,” I offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It crosses my mind quite a bit. I had a similar conversation driving with an uncle once when I was 15 or so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It crosses my mind quite a bit. I had a similar conversation driving with an uncle once when I was 15 or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Getting married,” he said, “takes away a lot of your options in life. Then having a kid takes away more options. Having two kids takes away even more options…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems so hopeless. We grow up and do all the things we dreamed of doing, like getting a cool job and having a family, but we feel that our options are limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it’s simply a spectrum of spontaneity to routine. Think of spontaneity as what it was like to be a child. You pretty much decided what you were going to right before it happened. Compare that to the elderly person who gets up and wears the same type of socks every day, goes to the same place, eats the same lunch every day. Routine, for some, is what keeps them alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we can play with this spectrum. We can think of it like a lever: there are choices we have to make to keep our routines in place, and somewhere in the mess of things, there is a a space for spontaneity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a space to jump in puddles, to stop and stare at a piece of artwork in a cafe, to listen to the street performer. There’s a space to explore the one room in your house that you never visit, to take a tour in your own city, to eat something completely outlandish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Routine binds the moments of our lives together in a way that makes sense, but spontaneity is what lives in the empty spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deep Breath</title>

&lt;p&gt;I was nervous right before the first time I sang in front of people on a stage. My friend, who was in the same choir as me, said “take a deep breath.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve thought of the “take a deep breath” line as a less direct version of “calm down, now you’re making &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; nervous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe it could mean something else. Because taking a breath is connected to being alive, and when we breathe, we are quite literally living. And breathing is happening in the present moment, which is why proper breathing is fundamental to any meditation practice. While we can think about the past, we can’t &lt;em&gt;breathe&lt;/em&gt; about the past.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Jungle Of Nutrition</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, a routine doctor’s visit got me &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; interested in what I was eating to cause high cholesterol. Surely, my diet couldn’t have been that bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was. The area that I lived in was full of walkable restaurants, and most of them used dramatic amounts of oil, sugar, and salt in their foods. At the time, I didn’t cook much. We did get mealkit delivery, but this gave us three meals a week at most. The rest was all takeout and eating out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We did get mealkit delivery, but this gave us three meals a week at most. The rest was all takeout and eating out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I decided to switch my way of eating, my first step was to figure out the best way to eat. If you’ve ever tried to figure out “the best way to eat,” then you know that there is a ton of conflicting advice. Some say that it’s best to eat low carb and high fat, some say low carb and high protein, some say it’s good to have a balance, some say you should avoid animal products, some say carbs are fine as long as they’re not processed… and the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could drive yourself mad with these suggestions. Not only are the diet suggestions abundant and diverse, but they’re also backed by studies and licensed doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commonality between all of these diets, though, is that processed and refined foods have no nutritional value and adverse affects on your body. If there’s any agreed upon “best way of eating,” it’s that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could watch, over the next 50 years, the popularity of many diets come and go. The paleo diet turned into the ketogenic diet, which turned into the carnivore diet, and so on. Vegetarian craze became the vegan craze which became the whole foods plant based craze. There are important things to learn from each movement, but to become a religious zealot around one of these ways of eating might cause us to forget the reason that we eat in the first place: nourishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, nourishment, both physically and emotionally. For a few months, I ate a salad in a jar every day. The ingredients were tasty on their own, but there was &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too much in the jar. I didn’t realize that salads are tastier when they’re simplistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, eating with people, or cooking for people, is part of what makes food so wonderful. Mindful eating, or concentrating on the eating process instead of mindlessly shoving food bits into your mouth, can help us nourish our relationships as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what the answer to healthy eating is, and I probably never will. But for now, my method is a mix of intuition (if it feels healthy, perhaps it is), mindfulness (I am conscious of every bite), and nutrition (food that is high in micronutrients, with very little removed).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fasting</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-11-11-fasting/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was a child, I remember asking my father why we (Muslims) fast during Ramadan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because it evens everything out,” he said. “There are Muslims in third world countries that are starving. They don’t have a choice but to fast. When we fast, we’re reminding ourselves of how lucky we are to have access to food when others don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t fast much during Ramadan when I was young, maybe once or twice in the month. The fasting day always felt extremely long, and that last 20 minutes as the sun dipped down into clouds seemed to take forever… but it was an amazing exercise in understanding how hunger works.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t fast much during Ramadan when I was young, maybe once or twice in the month. The fasting day always felt extremely long, and that last 20 minutes as the sun dipped down into clouds seemed to take forever… but it was an amazing exercise in understanding how hunger works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I experienced fasting, hunger seemed additive to me. That is, the longer waited, the hungrier I would get. But on a fasting day, when hunger hit (during my usual breakfast time or lunch), it would hit hard… and then dissipate as the hours went on. It came roaring back at certain points and reduce to a whimper during other points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I failed a few times on my way to completing a fast, but it felt like a huge accomplishment when I finally got through an entire day without eating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question came up recently: would I encourage my child to try fasting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, in both of the traditions he inherits from my wife and me, fasting is something that people do on occasion. But if we stripped away all of the religious requirements, if we forgot about those that must fast in third world countries, we’re left with somewhat of an inner battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The urge to eat, when food is sitting in your pantry, is satisfied without much effort. If I’m working or doing something active and I forget to eat lunch because I’m engaged with my task, then my “fast” was accidental. But to &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that food is in the pantry, and to say “I’m not eating that right now” even when every piece of your biology is saying that you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; eat? That takes courage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fasting is a practice in delayed gratitude. It’s a practice in creating space between us and our addictions, our needs, our wants. It’s how we prevent entitlement, addiction, and chronic disease. And if you can do it with the most essential need that humans have, you can do it with social media, shopping, and hatred as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; part of superpower means power that others do not have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, the collective consciousness, have infinite power between us. It’s essential to know what your superpower is, what you contribute to the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s probably not what your parents told you it is, or what you studied in college (though it might be).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might not be something for which you will ever be paid.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;If you set the start time for an event at 5, it’s because you have young children. Or perhaps a very efficient social life. Or perhaps a need for sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you set the start time for an event at 6, it’s because you want to go to bed early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you set the start time for an event at 7, it’s because you want to be social.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;And if it’s an “open house,” you give guests the opportunity to explore their motives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Meditating With Others</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For five minutes a day, over the last few months, I’ve spent time doing nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, I sit on a cushion or chair, without my phone, staring straight ahead at the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thoughts come and go and I observe them like the weather. Or at least, I try to – and if I get swept away, I forgive myself and try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a wonderful experience, not because it’s been calming or new age, but it’s enabled me to allow pain, happiness, and other emotions come to a boil and then reduce to a simmer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a wonderful experience, not because it’s been calming or new age, but it’s enabled me to allow pain, happiness, and other emotions come to a boil and then reduce to a simmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since meditation is a silent and personal activity, it always made me curious that people want to do it in groups. Monks at temples, buddhist practitioners, yoga classes… all include some form of group meditation. But a group can’t meditate, can they? What’s the benefit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered my answer to this while using the amazing meditation timer app InsightTimer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, let’s talk about breathing. Pema Chodron describes the act of breathing like this: when we inhale, we pull in everyone’s pain. When we breathe out, we send good vibes out to the rest of the universe. This can be a very healing experience in a room of people meditating silently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InsightTimer rings a bell at the start and end of a meditation session. And then, it does something powerful: it shows you all the other people that were meditating with you. You just see their first name and profile pic, nothing fancy. But in doing so, I suddenly realized that all of the 400-600 people that meditate with me across the world every day (and many more not on the app) are &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; experiencing the same struggle that I am – to remain grounded in the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while meditation &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a solitary activity, doing it in a group reminds us that we’re all experiencing an internal struggle that is invisible from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Angry Email</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-11-07-an-angry-email/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever written an angry email? Have you ever received one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be on either end of the exchange is stressful. On the receiving end, you read someone else’s scathing words with no opportunity to immediately respond. Like having your mouth stuffed with a cloth while someone circles you and berates you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when you’re writing an angry email, you’re processing your feelings. There’s a reason you chose email as a form of communication over a phone call or an in-person meeting, which is that it’s easier to call someone out when they can’t respond easily.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I once wrote an angry email to my doctor. He had falsely diagnosed with me a pretty serious disease, and it had affected my life and given me a fear of doctors and medicine. His misdiagnosis was so incredibly irresponsible (it was based on a single blood test, that ended up being erroneous) and I had nightmares about him, and the situation, for weeks. I was so angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided, one day at work, to tell him how his actions had affected me. I wrote a very lengthy email, telling him how irresponsible his diagnosis was, how I’d never come to his practice again, and how he needs to think about his practice critically when he works with other patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote the entire 5 paragraph email on my lunch break and read it back to myself. As I read through it, I realized that through the process of simply writing this email, I had healed myself (or started to heal myself). It wasn’t that I needed him to know anything at all, because it wouldn’t make a difference probably. I needed to let &lt;em&gt;myself&lt;/em&gt; know how I felt. That was all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never sent the email, but I did save it as a draft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a strategy I recommend for anyone who has anger toward another person. Write them a letter, but don’t send it. The process of writing is self-healing, much more than the other person experiencing your anger.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Smells Scents Aromas</title>

&lt;p&gt;A smell is defined, roughly, as the process by which your nose detects a scent and sends it to your brain for processing. It’s one of those special powers we have as animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scent is a characteristic smell. You’d know if it you smelled it again. Scents are things like asparagus, rubber, and coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An aroma is typically a pleasant scent. Whereas the scent classification would apply to a skunk odor, an aroma is a positive experience. Aromas are fresh fall leaves, Christmas, a fireplace, the cold night air.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;These aren’t separate things. All three are layers of the same idea, an almost indescribable olfactory sensation that creeps into our brain and reminds us that we’re present.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beautifully Flawed</title>

&lt;p&gt;“You’re beautifully flawed,” someone once said to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is there any type of flaw that isn’t beautiful? Is there such thing as an ugly flaw?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose what people mean when they say “beautifully flawed” is that they find my more challenging qualities endearing. They’re trying to communicate, in a compassionate way, that they accept me for who I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they do this because they know me, because we are friends. They’ve seen me at my worst, and they still went on loving me anyway. But when a politician or movie producer has some obvious flaws in their character, they aren’t beautiful anymore – they’re repulsive and horrible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Assuming no one is perfect (or everyone is perfect), we’ll all have qualities that others will either see as horrible, no good flaws, or beautiful flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; are the ones who assign values to other people’s flaws. We are the ones who say whether someone else’s flaws are beautiful or repulsive. In other words, we reserve judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to do then, as a human with flaws being judged by others? Perhaps the best course of action is to not assign value to our own flaws. Let’s let other people do it for us, for that is their task and has nothing to do with us, and let’s keep on living and moving forward with whatever it is we’ve got.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>To Nourish You</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think a lot about being a father. I mean, what it means to be a father, how one should conduct themselves as a father, how one should teach their children or at least provide the conditions necessary for their children to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, when my wife and I started talking about the possibility of having kids one day, I found myself more motivated than ever before to go to the gym and work out more. With every rep, and every mile I ran, I would say to my future child in my head, &lt;em&gt;this is for you.&lt;/em&gt; Sure, I wanted to improve my health in general, but I was mostly motivated by future fatherhood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;And now that I’m here, I’ve got the physical fitness somewhat under control, working out 3x a week and handling my (heavy) child a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in terms of nutrition, I’ve been making meal delivery kits fo the past few years. These can be quite nutritious, depending on what you believe about nutrition. But recently, I found myself wanting to learn how to cook, from scratch without a recipe and with unprocessed, mostly plant based ingredients, for the same reason I wanted to work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just wanting to provide nutritious meals for my child – it’s the act of making and sharing food with someone. If you think about the people you’ve shared meals with, who have graciously cooked for you, whose food you still crave years after they’re gone… there’s a nourishment that happens when someone cooks for you, a nourishment of both the body and the soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greatest gift a mother gives their child is their own milk, the stuff they created in their own bodies. Babies crave and obsess over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I can’t create milk to give my son, the best I can do is learn how to cook in a nutritious way for him. Foods that taste good and that do good things for his growing body. We could sit down, share food together, experience conversation while eating. We could enjoy the process of life through the meals we create and consume. And to that end, I’ll cook for him every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And perhaps one day, he’ll cook for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the dentist’s office. In the shopping mall. In my parent’s car. At the grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these places played the radio station Wash FM when I was a kid. Wash FM marketed itself as the “best music of the 70’s, 80’s, and 90’s.” They eventually updated their slogan to “and today” when the 2000’s hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this station, you’d often hear artists like Jon Secada, Toni Braxton, Michael Bolton, Kenny G and other soft rock super stars. And at night, it would transition entirely over to love songs, and you could hear over-the-phone dedications from lovers to their partners.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This was an important radio station for our community. Because it was family friendly, non-offensive, non-distorted pop music, &lt;em&gt;any institution&lt;/em&gt; could play it. And those beautiful songs lined the walls of my childhood, influencing me, and changing the way I hear music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were playing in the background when I got my teeth cleaned, when I visited the doctor for a cold, when I sat waiting in traffic with my mom in the car, when I wandered around the mall looking for anything exciting as a teenager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The songs themselves don’t matter very much. I found some great songs that I loved on there, but nothing that has lasted a significantly long time. It’s the station itself, its very existence, that I am thankful for.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been fascinated by people’s laughs since I was young. Almost like an audio fingerprint, a person’s laugh is perfectly customized to who they are. Even when they have a laugh you weren’t expecting (say, a very large man with a high pitched giggle), the laugh still seems to “capture” a person’s spirit in a simple sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also noticed how my own laugh changes. When I was a kid, it was a full loud belly laugh. When I became a teenager, I had more of a gasping sort of laugh. A few years ago, it was a high pitched “HAH HAH.” I still get that one if I’m really laughing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wish I could map out how my laugh has shifted and evolved, and perhaps compare it to what was going on in my life at the time, who I was friends with, and what I found funny. It’d be an interesting study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laughs shift subtly just like platectonics. But so does a person’s smile, touch, tastes, and almost everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blog post that really influenced my thinking was Derek Sivers post titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://sivers.org/hellyeah&#34;&gt;“Hell Yeah.”&lt;/a&gt; In the post, Derek advises his readers to say no to anything that they don’t want to say “hell yes” to. And knowing that this isn’t always possible, at least it can be a default framework with which to make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consultant, my instinct is to say yes to everything that seems like it could eventually be important. It stresses me out and slows me down, though. Eventually, all of those yesses create quite a few messes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I expected this book to be something like Mark Manson’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. However, it was &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book, written by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga, covers Adlerian psychology, which is in some ways opposed to popular Freudian psychology. Of course, one could learn about Adler’s psychology theories from reading his books… but as the author describes, he’s meant to be Adler’s Plato.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Of course, one could learn about Adler’s psychology theories from reading his books… but as the author describes, he’s meant to be Adler’s Plato.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, he tells Adler’s story in a compelling way. The entire book reads kind of like a play between two characters (plus a neutral narrator that chimes in occasionally). It’s a conversation between a teacher and one of his students, a young man. Throughout the book they argue about things like…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trauma, and how it doesn’t exist. Whereas Freud believes that we are who we are because of things that happened in our past, Adler believes that we construct who we are, we choose our lifestyle, and then fill in the details in a narrative. I believe that I’m traumatized by a nasty boss; Adler would tell me that I created the nasty boss narrative as a way of avoiding taking responsibility for whatever my issues were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He argues that if we judge the value of a human based on their being, rather than their acts, everyone is a contributor, and realizing this creates true and immediate happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very end, the “teacher” makes the argument that there is not future or past, and that life is a series of moments that we live in the present. Not too far off from a Zen way of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also discussed vertical relationships (where there’s a hierarchy of power) and horizontal relationships (when both people matter just as much). The teacher and the boy start from a vertical relationship and end up in a horizontal one by the end of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend it – the audio book kept me totally engaged for a 2 hour car ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve felt this way before: moderately stressed, such as a sports performance or a high stakes test. You’ve also felt stress-free, such as on vacation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a few years now, I’ve kept myself in the moderately stressed zone. I find it works best for me, and I’d guess many of my friends would relate. When my systems for productivity and wellness get pushed to their limits, I’m always excited to see that I can handle more than I thought.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

When my systems for productivity and wellness get pushed to their limits, I’m always excited to see that I can handle more than I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But – and this happens in a split second – another unexpected event happens, like I need to leave unexpectedly late at night for a work event because I waited till the last minute to check the address and it’s too far away for a morning commute. Something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now I’m over-stressed. Any extra thing feels like it weighs a million pounds and it’s hard to know when the next moment of reprieve will come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It happens so fast, going from perfectly stressed to overly stressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I need to pay attention to the feeling I feel right before the tipping point. Perhaps that’s my cue for a margarita. Which will make me feel like I’m being lazy. Which will make me stressed of course.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Completely Delusional</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, I wanted to be a pop star. I was thrilled by the idea of writing songs and performing on stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to satisfy myself, I began performing on stages, playing my own songs at the age of 7. At family gatherings, I’d dance like Michael Jackson. In high school, I’d play my songs at parties and I’d think super carefully about my set list and banter. I’d perform magic for anyone who would watch. I still do these things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t really &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. But to me, it didn’t get any better than this. To be able to create something interesting on the spot, live, in front of people… was exhilarating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all changed after college. I got self conscious. I was afraid of releasing things. I realized that everyone else thought magic was for geeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could learn a lot from my younger self, as much as I shit on him. Because the secret was that back then I wasn’t &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to be something, I wasn’t even doing the “fake it till you make it” thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I was just completely delusional. Which I’m starting to believe is what it takes to be a true artist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I studied marketing in college, and we studied it the right way. We were taught how to adjust product, price, and brand to meet the demands of a segment of the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I started reading about marketing online and most of the content was about how to get a higher search result on Google, how to increase follower count, how to “hustle” and make money, and a bunch of other to-dos that are more about having bragging rights than they are about marketing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;One of those to-dos is to create a sense of urgency. You see this tactic being used when there’s a sign that says the sale ends in 24 hours. Infomercials use it to when they say &lt;em&gt;call in the next 20 minutes for a free thing!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s harder to create urgency when someone is a door-to-door marketer, unless you repair roof shingles. A few roof repair companies in the area have stopped by my house to tell me that my roof is falling apart, and it just so happens they’re in my area and can give me a free estimate. I hate it and I never do anything but the shut the door on these people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But another time I was in the Ikea parking lot, and a guy drove up and offered to remove the dents from my car while I was shopping. I declined, but I’ve thought about it for years. How simple it would have been to just pay him $100 to come back to a dent-free car. No need to make an appointment at the mechanic or spend extra time on it. It was great marketing: there’s a guy with a dented car, and someone who fixes that exact problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I aspire to be that type of person who has the exact solution for an exact problem. Forget about jobs, careers, promotions, raises… if I can be this type of person, then perhaps a lot of other pieces will fall into place, naturally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was with someone the other day that I didn’t know very well. I asked them how they were doing, and they said “ah, you know, the days are long the years are short.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It stuck with me. It’s such an interesting problem: on one hand, it’s scary how quickly the years seem to fly by, but the day can stretch out, hour by hour, seemingly forever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In this way, perhaps, life is short but also wide. The century or so that we’re here can go by in a flash, but living in the present moment can keep us grounded in our day-to-day life. The best part of it all is that the day’s are already long, we could just choose to enjoy the lengthiness… and then perhaps the years won’t seem as short.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can overdose on almost anything: drugs, alcohol, talk radio, politics, religion. But there are fewer drugs that you can microdose on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the dolphin swimming 100 feet below you, you kind of have to sense the drug in your system, and how it’s making you feel. In other words, you have to connect your body with your mind, which is so simple in concept and hard to do in practice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever taken a drug that had no real side effects and tried to feel it work inside your body? Have you ever tried to feel yourself digest food? Have you tried to feel your heart pump blood?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why microdosing could be valuable: you can sharpen your sense of deep and subtle sensations and vibrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can expand your mind just by trying to notice its presence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Real Confidence</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-10-25-on-real-confidence/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 25 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-10-25-on-real-confidence/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my early 20’s, I was stupidly confident. That type of stupid confidence that leads you to say things to people that you regret in your 30’s, that type of stupid confidence that isn’t really confidence at all, but is more a symptom of overwhelming insecurity. The kind of confidence that whispers in your ear, &lt;em&gt;just do it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I refer to this confidence as “stupid,” it actually led to a lot of interesting opportunities, many of which define who I am today. There were a lot of bold moves that resulted in nothing, like one time I tweeted a half finished song at one of my favorite singer-songwriters to see if he wanted collaborate (he turned me down, but I ended up opening for him a few years later in DC). Another time, I emailed the CEO of IBM to ask if I could interview him on my podcast (he never wrote back). With every “no,” my confidence only got stronger somehow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Another time, I emailed the CEO of IBM to ask if I could interview him on my podcast (he never wrote back). With every “no,” my confidence only got stronger somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was one time that I’ll never forget, one instance where I came face to face with just how stupid and small my confidence really was. It was when someone actually responded to one of my crazy requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an up and coming blogger, who I won’t name because they might see this post (not that it would matter at this point). This was about 12 years ago. At the time, I was realizing just how reachable people were on the internet, after having my emails returned from mammoths like Seth Godin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blogger had written about the idea of a one-sentence daily journal, and I emailed her to ask if I could code up an electronic version of the one-sentence journal for her for free. My idea was that we’d create this relationship, this partnership, and it could lead to other important opportunities later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expected a “no.” But she wrote back with a “let me think about it.” And eventually, a “yes, let’s do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was the last time we communicated, 12 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I froze up. I realized I was in over my head. And maybe I wasn’t, maybe I had the coding skills to make this happen, but at that moment in time, I didn’t believe I did. So I never wrote back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that blogger is now a celebrity, with many bestselling books and a podcast and everything else. And I’m not saying I regret not writing because I would’ve been associated with someone important. But it does make me think about what real confidence is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real confidence would have looked like honing a craft, of writing program after program and failing over and over again, of having an actual record of success rather than just a commitment to “grinding.” We talk so much about just asking, just reaching out, just saying please. It takes a second to get over the fear of emailing someone, but it takes years to become so valuable that someone emails &lt;em&gt;you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can’t deliver on our promises, all the assertiveness in the world won’t help. Real confidence isn’t what you say, it’s what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They must have meant jigsaw, but when I hear the word &lt;em&gt;puzzle&lt;/em&gt;, I think about the mysteries that surround me in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to frame these puzzles? The ones that keep us up at night, that confuse and befuddle us, that amaze us and terrify us?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it’s the same way we’d frame the jig saw – we assemble the pieces in a way that gives them meaning, and then we show everyone the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But once that’s done, and once our wall is full of framed puzzles….what next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoever this person is, they don’t really understand how viruses work. If content goes viral, it happens nearly automatically, which means there was no need for the request in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My wife and I switch who’s on and off at night when we take care of our son. Some nights, she’s out exercising or seeing a friend while I’m chasing our toddler around the living room. And other nights, I’m writing or cooking or having dinner with someone while she’s bathing him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to write on the nights when I’m on not looking after him. But occasionally, the sound of joy leaks down into the basement and draws me up. It sounds like giggling, sometimes her, sometimes him, and sometimes both. If it’s both then I have to go see.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I like to write on the nights when I’m on not looking after him. But occasionally, the sound of joy leaks down into the basement and draws me up. It sounds like giggling, sometimes her, sometimes him, and sometimes both. If it’s both then I have to go see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this one evening it was during his bath. I opened the door and there they were in a surreal and perfect moment: she was blowing store-bought bubbles into the bath. They were landing on his skin, and he was reaching out to grab them, and then they’d pop. And he’d say, “pop!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How mysterious it must be for the child with bubbles. To be able to see something, to want to touch it so much, and then it’s gone. It’s gone &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; you touched it. You can’t even feel what it felt like. It’s just a memory now, so quickly, its quiet echo reverberating in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’d pop the bubble and look around for more, my wife being happy to oblige.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bathtub is his school house and these are his lessons. My wife figured out that he became entranced if she held a bucket over him and poured down a stream of water so that it was just in front of his face. He’d reach out and try to grab it, but just like with the bubbles, there was nothing to hold on to. You would think he’d be frustrated, but that innate wonder all children have eclipsed any potential frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learn so much about living when I watch him play. All at once a student, a teacher, a vibration, and a flicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a very short time, months perhaps, this bubble popping and stream of water inquiry will become like the bubbles themselves: gone but remembered fondly through their quiet echo, a thing we could marvel at in the moment but could not contain even if we tried.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m sitting on my couch staring out the window, a practice I do quite often these days, and all of a sudden I’m thinking about the times we spent together. I’m thinking about your laugh, your smile, the way you hold a tea cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it simply: I miss you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I start to wonder what’s happening in my head that I miss you. Was it the bird I noticed outside the window that reminded me of how windows let me see things, and was it that thought that took me to the kitchen window where we sat eating popcorn, and was it that image that brought back the aromas and smells of my childhood kitchen? Was that what made me miss you?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Was it the bird I noticed outside the window that reminded me of how windows let me see things, and was it that thought that took me to the kitchen window where we sat eating popcorn, and was it that image that brought back the aromas and smells of my childhood kitchen? Was that what made me miss you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And are we made to miss people? Or does the “missing” just happen, like thoughts flitting across the stage of our mind? Is missing just a form of thinking but with a more severe form of attachment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, I hope we can get together sometime and talk about all of this. Whether “missing” happens to me or it’s something I do, all I know is that if you were here to talk to, I’d feel at least 3% better.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kind Acts Privately</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-10-20-kind-acts-privately/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I decided to donate to someone’s online fundraiser. They were going through a hard time and needed money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I went to the checkout, there was a checkbox that said “Do you want to remain anonymous?” Checking this box meant that my name wouldn’t be included on the GoFundMe page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I paused for a minute to think about &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I would want to make my name known as a donor. My first thought was maybe that people might see my name and think that I’m cheap, that I donated an amount that was below the unspoken standard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But then I realized that what I was doing, ultimately, was trying to help someone in need. And that not even &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; need to know who I am, or that I chose to be a donor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to make the act of charity about ourselves, our own need to be seen a hero, when it really should be about the person who we’re helping. So from now on, when I do an act of kindness, to make sure that it’s really genuine, I’m not going to tell anyone about it. If possible, not even the person who I’m helping.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Your Life As A Movie</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In some ways, we experience our lives a bit like we might experience a movie. Events happen, we react to them. We’re the audience &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the protagonist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, unlike the audience and protagonist, we end up creating emotions from scratch. We decide our own triggers, habits, likes, and dislikes. We decide what deserves the audience’s attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people go through life feeling like the actor and the audience only, without realizing they also produce and direct this show, with a script that is being revealed in pieces, like episodes of a show. No one knows who the writer is, only that they’re crazy and need to be locked up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;When I created this blog, I thought I would import all of my old blog posts to make this archive comprehensive. I’ve been writing since 2001 (Livejournal), so I have a lot of posts backed up. While I haven’t written daily until just a few years ago, I went through stints of writing in my blog every few months or years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I imported all of my old posts, some written when I was just 15 years old, I cringed. What an idiot, I thought. How foolish. I made the posts hidden immediately.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I hope not. I hope I remember that wisdom accumulates, and that this writing represents a certain temporal location, a certain point in existence, and therefore it’s just about as perfect as anything else in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems like every day as an adult, life becomes more &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;. All the things we feared as children are coming true: disease, death, broken relationships, and other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like no one actually taught us what do when we grieve. Whether it’s losing a loved one or a childhood bed, no one taught us how to handle it when we need to say goodbye to something that has accumulated so much meaning in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Our teachers never taught us how to grieve because it wasn’t on the test. And our parents may have tried, but no one taught them how to grieve either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a few years ago when I, on a whim, went to a class on grief. I don’t remember much from this class, except for one important thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Processing grief,” the instructor said, “is something your brain does all on its own. It’s an amazing computer and it has all the instruction it needs. You don’t need to do anything at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people try really hard to control a bad situation. Any form of control at all helps and makes us feel like we have agency, and that we’re &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; at the whim of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you’ve been playing the spiritual game long enough, you know that this is a misconception. We &lt;em&gt;are entirely&lt;/em&gt; at the whim of the universe. We could choose to sit back and watch. And in times of joy, this is a lot easier to do, although even then we try to recreate joyful situations over and over, trying to find the thing we’re looking for until we realize that we already have the thing we’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In times of sadness and grief, this is much harder to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let it flow,” the instructor of this class told us. “There is nothing to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;. Just &lt;em&gt;let.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let, which is one of the most beautiful words in the English language is the start of most math problems. Defining &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; ourselves is a recipe for disaster. It’s like trying to label the contents of a box that we can’t open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we allow or let variables take a shape, instead of trying to define them ourselves, it sure makes the math process much more fluid.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Having Or Holding Ideas</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-10-14-having-or-holding-ideas/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;David Allen, productivity writer and author of one of my favorite books, Getting Things Done, has famously said that the mind is for having ideas, not holding ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is to say, we are at our best when are being creative, thinking up new solutions to old problems, and generating ideas. What we’re not good at is remembering all of our appointments in our head, which is why we need a calendar. Or that we have a number of items due by the end of the month, which is why we need a task list. Using those kind of systems religiously can yield amazing results for our creative brain, which is now free to have ideas instead of hold them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Using those kind of systems religiously can yield amazing results for our creative brain, which is now free to have ideas instead of hold them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the idea of sustaining this kind of habit for years or even a lifetime is daunting for many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, it was simple: once I experienced a taste of what it was like to free up my brain to have ideas instead of hold them, almost everything in my life changed. I became more productive, but not just in the sense of being busy… I was actually creating and producing important work that helped or transformed the people I served.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I even got into the habit of writing down &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; idea I had, either in a paper notebook or in an app. This has also made my life better: when I sit down to work, I now can pull from a list rather than scratch my head and procrastinate for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I got a taste of that, I was hooked. My most creative ideas happen now when I’m doing something other than work – when I’m bored, or on the train, or driving. In other words, my brain is doing what it naturally wants to do, which is to have ideas. The system in charge of holding those ideas does the rest of the work, and everyone wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procrastination doesn’t really exist for me anymore unless I’m faced with a challenge I’ve never thought about and need to solve quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t scratch your itch,” my mom would say when I got a bug bite as a child. “It’ll make it worse. Let the medicine do its work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medicine could be anti-histamine, music, or Advil. But we refuse, don’t we, just to let the medicine do its work. We’d rather scratch because it &lt;em&gt;feels satisfying&lt;/em&gt; than sit with our discomfort, keep our hands off of it, and let it evaporate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Its Not A Meme</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;These days, a &lt;em&gt;meme&lt;/em&gt; is how people describe a picture that has text over it in a particular font. It’s a piece of art that captures the zeitgeist of internet culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the meaning of the word has changed. Memes may &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; a certain way, and they can be emulated with apps and generators…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it used to be that a meme meant something more specific. It referred to a specific photo, video, or idea that went viral, that was modified and bastardized, beaten to its very last breath. Think of nyaan cat or success fist pumping kid or the african child with the white woman.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Simply putting big text over a photo doesn’t make it a meme. That’s perhaps a parody of a meme but it misses the point. The meme hits the mark, and it inspires us in its odd way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Amalgamation Of Others</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, you might hear people say, “eh, they sound like they’re trying to sound like Bob Dylan.” Replace Bob Dylan with whomever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say it like it’s a bad thing, but it’s a &lt;em&gt;good thing&lt;/em&gt;. That means that the part of them that may have been inspired by Bob Dylan (or artists that inspired Bob Dylan) are shining through more than others, at that particular moment, and for that particular listener.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Because to another listener, that artist might sound like Nick Drake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s like when you taste a soup and can pick out the tomatoes in the flavor profile, but your friend tastes the seasoning. It’s not a bad soup; it’s flavor profile is complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next level for an artist happens when it’s hard to put a finger on influences. The genius is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; an amalgamation, but they’ve put enough uniqueness into the mix that it’s unnoticeable. They are uniquely themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is good too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the amalgamation is still good. It reminds us that there is a progression to mastery and genius, and every artist must pass through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook, Twitter, Instagram… all of them have “like” buttons (and some have more). But none of them have “dislike” buttons. There are anger buttons, sadness buttons… but no dislike. No thumbs down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are good reasons for this, though I don’t know if these are the reasons that there aren’t dislike buttons. For instance, seeing a dislike number next to your posts might cause self-consciousness, and might cause you to post less, which is the opposite of what social media sites want.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Except on Reddit, and also YouTube. On these sites, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; dislike or downvote comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit can sometimes be the home for very civilized discussions. Part of this is that they have something called “rediquette” or community expectations. This is the same thing you might find in a kindergarten classroom: a list of norms that people generally try to follow. Very few of these other sites go that far, and in fact, some of them are against the idea of expectations in the name of free speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The YouTube comment section has no rules, no etiquette, and so it is a total mess, with hatred spewing on almost every video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free speech is important, but a few guidelines for how to behave can turn a network from a distraction to a useful asset.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve never made a big decision. One might think that buying a house, getting married, switching careers (twice), and having kids would qualify as big decisions but I don’t see them that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see each of these as a series of tiny little decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took two years to leave my job and become a teacher. I took tiny little steps to get there. Some research into programs, an informational interview here or there, some savings to make sure I could afford the pay cut.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Before getting married, I made the decision to spend more nights at my girlfriend’s place to see what it was like to live with her. Then we moved in together. After that, the decision to propose was almost an after thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And having kids, which was a big decision, came after I decided to clean up my diet, exercise more, and remove some other bad habits from my life. My biggest fear about having kids was that I didn’t feel like an adult myself, so those tiny little choices made me ready for the bigger shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all of these situations, there was a fence I needed to get over for the change to happen, a moment of shift. But that hop wasn’t a &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; decision. I had been throwing all of my stuff over the fence for quite some time. And when all my stuff was over the fence, I climbed over as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Responsibilities As Creators And Consumers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When we engage on the web, we’re either taking the role of the creator or the consumer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re either the ones writing the blog posts and directing the videos, or we’re the ones reading and watching them. This role changes often throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consumer, we have a responsibility to change the channel if we’re not into what we’re seeing. Yes, it’s important to develop a world view, to see perspectives that don’t match ours… but instead of complaining about how annoying everyone on Twitter is, better to just whittle down the follower list until the experience becomes better. It’s on &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; as consumers to change the channel, not on the creators.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;As a creator, we have a responsibility to speak our minds fully and without a filter. This only works when consumers take &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; responsibility of changing channels more seriously. It means that less people might see what we create (because honesty can be polarizing sometimes), but it will mean that the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; people see what we create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two acts, consuming and creating, exist in harmony as long as both parties adhere to their responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Positive And Negative Emotions</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-10-07-positive-and-negative-emotions/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In teacher training, a group of us were asked to create a bunch of drawings, each with a different face and on a different sheet of paper, and each one representing a different emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After collectively brainstorming about a hundred of emotions on the sheets, we were asked to sort them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sort them?” we asked. “By what criteria?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just sort them,” our instructors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we decided to sort them by negative to positive emotions. Emotions like sad, depressed, and anxious went on the left hand side, while emotions like exuberant, joyful, and elated went to the right.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So we decided to sort them by negative to positive emotions. Emotions like sad, depressed, and anxious went on the left hand side, while emotions like exuberant, joyful, and elated went to the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we were done (after about 30 minutes of working), we stepped back and looked at our arrangement. The room was silent for a few minutes, and then someone said…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know. Can emotions be positive or negative?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A discussion ensued. On one hand, an emotion can be seen as someone’s body and mind giving them feedback. Information. On the other hand, no one says they’re going away to the mountains for a weekend to cultivate anger. Perhaps some of the emotions we described as negative were really just undesirable, but even that word doesn’t seem toe be accurate. After all, we can’t know joy without sadness. Why would we desire sadness any less than joy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a better word for those emotions we’d rather not have is “uncomfortable.” Still necessary, still desirable in order to balance and provide perspective, but uncomfortable nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, we re-arranged our emotions in alphabetical order. It was the only solution that made the most sense to us as a group.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Childlike</title>

&lt;p&gt;Most adults spend their time trying to get back to the state they were in as children, which is fascinating. Through all of our yoga, mediation, walks in the woods, psychedelics… we’re trying to experience the feeling of being in pure amazement, like we’re seeing everything as if it’s the first time. Small children have zero issues feeling this way; it’s their natural state.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Small children have zero issues feeling this way; it’s their natural state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I watch my son play, I often imagine what might be going through his mind. He’s not anxious yet because he doesn’t understand how the world works. So he just sets off every day and expresses himself. He learns to walk, not because he believes he’ll get a reward, not because he can post to Facebook about his achievements, but because he just &lt;em&gt;really wants to walk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a model for us as adults too. If we’re aiming to be childlike, that desire in and of itself isn’t childlike at all. If we are meditating so that we can post our meditation accomplishments to Facebook, we’re missing the point. If we’re doing yoga so that we can post impressive pictures of ourselves… etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being childlike comes naturally. It’s an expression. Kids do things because they are moved to do it by some internal compass, a compass that gets buried as they grow up and become adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But rest assured – it’s still there, under all the dirt and mud, pointing to true north.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building A Ship By Relating</title>

&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, from the age of 5 to 18, all I wanted was a girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was &lt;em&gt;desperate&lt;/em&gt; to be accepted, by anyone. Like many teenagers, I’d do things that I thought would impress girls, but that actually made me look foolish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All because no one ever taught me, explicitly or implicitly, what a relationship actually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I had for a model of a teen relationship was my friends. They bent over backwards to say and do macho type things. It seemed to me that the girls in my school really wanted someone who broke rules, someone who was extremely confident.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In other words, we all tried too hard. It worked for some, but I wouldn’t call what they had a relationship… they had courtships, prom dates, and make out partners. But hardly anyone was focused on the &lt;em&gt;relating&lt;/em&gt; part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I could give advice to my younger self, it would be this: relationships happen when you focus on the relation part. The common bond. The shared values. And relationships aren’t always sexual, and in fact, they can still be deeply satisfying without sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, after a bad break up in high school, I stopped trying to &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; someone, and at college, for the first time, I was open to all the new possibilities my social life offered me. I connected to people, I talked deeply with them until 5am, I learned where they were from and why they left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, out of this openness came the most important relationship of my life, the one that led to an eventual marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we still have crushes on each other. We never seem to tire of one another, at least not long term. And that’s because, I suspect, we started with &lt;em&gt;relation&lt;/em&gt; and from that, we built a ship.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using The Dictionary Strategically</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I once saw a piece of advice for writers and poets to look up words in the dictionary that you already know the meaning of (or at least, you think you do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing so can reveal some amazing new qualities of the word, especially when the words are related to things you do in your daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, I recently looked up the word technology, which I would’ve previously described as “computer-y type stuff.” It turns out the definition (from Webster’s) is much wider: practical uses of scientific discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;That’s beautiful: not only does the word technology then cover almost everything from the use of fire to cook, to the wheel, to the human language and beyond… but the dictionary also revealed that the greek roots of the word roughly translate to “the science of craft.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How breathtaking. Technology is then a confluence of art and science, a fusion of two disciplines that are often talked about as silos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all of this, just from looking up a word that I use on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day, I was walking on the street when a man asked me if I had any money to spare. I replied as I usually do… “sorry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, this time, when I said “sorry,” I noticed something interesting about the function of that word in this situation. Which is that it’s an apology, but not an answer to the question of if I have any change to spare.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt; answer to the question may sound like “No, I’m not giving money out at this time. Sorry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s hard to say the first part. It’s hard to say no to someone who is need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same goes for job or gig emails. I went back and forth with a hotel about playing in their lobby during my visit, and after some phone calls, they just ghosted me and never got back to me. How hard would it have been to just email back and say no?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard, apparently… since we avoid it so much. We don’t want to seem disagreeable, but perhaps it’s worse to be seen as an ineffective communicator.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Work Life Balance Equation</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-10-01-work-life-balance-equation/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things that’s kept me energized and uplifted over the last year as a new parent has been my job. Many other people that I’ve spoken to actually dreaded going back to their job after time off with their kids. I enjoyed every single moment of my paternity leave and would live inside of it if I could… but when I returned to work, the chaos from having a newborn started to subside a bit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;One of the things that’s kept me energized and uplifted over the last year as a new parent has been my job. Many other people that I’ve spoken to actually dreaded going back to their job after time off with their kids. I enjoyed every single moment of my paternity leave and would live inside of it if I could… but when I returned to work, the chaos from having a newborn started to subside a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this moment coincided with my son going to daycare, and also becoming a little more independent in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But often when we talk about work/life balance, we’re more concerned with making the “life” side of the equation bigger. This is the case for me too. I kept wondering how I could stay present in the moment while constantly worrying about work. It’s a habit loop that many parents I know fall into, especially those who work in education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer, for me, came from having a job that I like and being able to decide when the job was over every day. And since I’m a traveling consultant, my day usually ends the minute I walk in the door from wherever I’ve been that day. When I was an elementary school teacher, I never seemed to be able to find the time to separate from work, due to the demanding nature of the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now, I’m more present with my child. I schedule my day in such a way that work gets done when it’s time for work, and when it’s time to play with my son, I’m truly playing, improvising, imagining, and exploring. It’s absolutely wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I couldn’t have those moments of beauty and play without the moments of routine and structure that my job provides. It’s a yin yang. I feel like I have a purpose in the working world, and I feel the freedom to discover my purpose as a father in the other pockets of time that exist in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restructuring our lives, if we need to, is an important activity. Doing work that matters and doesn’t take advantage of us is important too, even if it takes a while to find it. It’s not just about trying to work less, but about packing value in the times when you’re not at your job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If work life balance means mindless web surfing, we might still find yourself yearning for more. Intentionality, purposefully deciding what we will do with our precious moments, can unlock the joy that was in front of us the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Two Important Communication Types</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-09-30-two-important-communication-types/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You could split communication into about a million cross sections. Here are a couple that are worth mentioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct communication: when you say what you mean, using economy of language (as few words as possible to clearly communicate a point).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Responsive Communication: when you say what you mean, but you frame it in the context of the human needs of love and acceptance. Along with your “point” is also empathy, understanding, and acceptance of the other person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have tried to argue that the second type is too flowery, too sugar coated. I would argue that it’s a necessary way to truly communicate anything that important. You can’t remove human needs and emotions from any communication, even at work. It’s essential to consider these needs in every interaction if you want to make a difference or change someone’s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Many bloggers have argued that productivity is the goal, and then there are others who say that it’s more about the quality of the day rather than how much was accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should we focus on being busy or satisfied?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are merits to both. When we’re busy, our mind is occupied by our tasks. We are engrossed in what we’re doing, and occasionally we hit the point of “flow.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Satisfied is being able to fall asleep at night knowing that you moved the needle on whatever you wanted to move the needle on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t have to pick one or the other. It’s fine to be in a state of flow without feeling like you moved the needle. Then it becomes about process. And it’s also fine to spend 20 minutes on the thing you’ve been meaning to spend 20 minutes on. That’s about joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we can be both… there’s nothing like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know it as a get together where all guests bring a little bit of food, and together we have a huge meal to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 16th century, the word meant “food provided for an unexpected or uninvited guest.” Our modern definition likely began in the 1930’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern execution of a potluck is based on convenience. I often suggest potlucks when I don’t want to have to cook for a huge audience. But the original idea was about care, specifically for someone unknown.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;If someone shows up to a party uninvited or unexpected, most hosts would be confused and potentially ask the person to leave. But in the original potluck, that person would be welcomed in, and there would even be a bit of food set aside for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which means that those who had the original potluck &lt;em&gt;expected the unexpected&lt;/em&gt; They welcomed, potentially, strangers. They nourished people without question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, it’s unlikely someone unexpected would show up to your dinner party. But unexpected people and events occur every single day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will you choose to nourish or withhold?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The sound of the radio signal in Contact. You know, the signal that Jodie Foster and her team receive that leads them to uncover the plans to build that machine that sends her off into space to meet her dead father? The steady crunch crunch sound it made, like a gigantic robot in the distance crushing trees to get to your house. And then there’s a moment in the film where the noise just stops and there’s an incredible silence that hangs over the team. Then… crunch, crunch. It’s beautiful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sound of the phone booth in Bill and Ted’s excellent adventure as it’s getting ready to disappear into the ground and fly through time. There’s something magical about the fake electrical noises that the little antenna made at the top of the booth. Combined with the music from the movie, it created a beautiful moment of waiting right before the phone booth gets sucked into the ground and through the time tunnel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sound of spells being cast in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. As Nerdwriter on YouTube has pointed out, the magic sounds in the third movie (directed by Alfonso Cuaron) weren’t cartoonish or realistic. They were quiet and pulsing, which is a sound quality rarely used in mainstream hero movies.&lt;/li&gt;

Combined with the music from the movie, it created a beautiful moment of waiting right before the phone booth gets sucked into the ground and through the time tunnel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sound of spells being cast in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. As Nerdwriter on YouTube has pointed out, the magic sounds in the third movie (directed by Alfonso Cuaron) weren’t cartoonish or realistic. They were quiet and pulsing, which is a sound quality rarely used in mainstream hero movies.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Parents Are Mirrors</title>

&lt;p&gt;It’s not just a pride thing, though pride has a lot to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it’s more primal than that. A few months after my son was born, I was talking to another parent with a 20 year old daughter. The way that she was expressing her affection and admiration of her daughter sounded exactly like the way I expressed affection and admiration of my own child. 20 years later, she was still just as in love.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The way that she was expressing her affection and admiration of her daughter sounded exactly like the way I expressed affection and admiration of my own child. 20 years later, she was still just as in love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I get it now,” I told her. “All parents walk around with admiration for their child bubbling up. Like low key, all day, and no one knows it except other parents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get a parent talking about their child and they’ll go on for quite some time. Out come the photos, the videos, the artwork from daycare…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this so that our child can thrive. Because what children need most is safety, structure, and for someone to see perfection in what others see as just another ordinary individual. They need someone to remind them that they’re messy and perfect individuals, and that we embrace their particular mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hell, we all need someone who does that. And certainly there are some parents who are ashamed or fed up with their children. Some parents who have internal issues to deal with, or hard conversations to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think our kids are awesome partially because we made them, but also because it’s a biological mechanisms that allows us to give our kids what they really need. We see the best in them, and we act as a mirror to reflect that goodness back onto our children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This goes for anyone you interact with, child or not… if you haven’t found the best in them, you haven’t looked hard enough.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How we welcome new people to the world is important. After all, we were once greeted for the first time and how it happened mattered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did with my son when we arrived home from the hospital was giving him a tour of his house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I showed him the bedrooms, bathrooms, the cool lights in the living room, and the hidden crawl space in the laundry room.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if he’ll ever remember it, or if he was even awake for it. All I know is that’s how I’d want to enter the world (at least, post-hospital). With an orientation, a sense of home, a map of the place you always return to.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve managed to live in 2019 without watching Game of Thrones, one of the most popular TV shows among my peer group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not that I’m avoiding the show; I just never got into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, it’s hard for me to imagine how &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; could live without having seen Breaking Bad, Six Feet Under, and Buffy. Those shows have transformed me, and I can’t imagine what would life would be like if I hadn’t watched and thought about them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Of course, life would be just fine without some of the shows. Transformation happens anyway, and it’s likely that some other piece of art would changed me in a different way if those shows hadn’t made their way into my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out transformation isn’t something you can prevent or stimulate. One day you’re &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;, and the next day you’re &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Percolate Vs Prolific</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Part of my training as an artist was reading many books on creativity. The common theme among many of these books was that an artist needs to be prolific, to push out as many ideas as possible, and to not worry about making them perfect. Execution, I learned, was more important than excellence (which is still important).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But experience has taught me that this is only part of the puzzle. Another key component to art-making is percolation. Letting ideas sit around for a while, gathering stored energy, before they leap out into the world. Most of my best stuff comes instantaneously, when I’m trying to be prolific… but the best &lt;em&gt;version&lt;/em&gt; of whatever the idea was happens if I let it be for some time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;If I record a song before I’ve played it at a bunch of shows, the quality suffers. If I write a book about thoughts that I haven’t explored before writing the book, the quality suffers. On and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old ideas are like older bottles of wine. They’re more pungent but they are grimier, meatier, and they’ve grown legs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yogis wear robes, Doctors wear lab coats, which are a modernized version of a robe. Cops wear badges and security wears dark colors. Fathers grow bears to solidify authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what all of these costumes do is provide a sense of identity. Identity is useful for those who wear the masks, but also for those who engage with the mask-wearers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do this too. I wear ties when I want to be seen as someone respectable, someone worthy of being heard. I wear contacts over glasses if I need to look someone in the eye, if I’m selling something, if there’s trust involved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Beneath these costumes, there are people. It seems an obvious statement, but it’s easy to forget that the doctor doing your physical is worried about his child being bullied. The meditation teacher that seems to flow out of her robes is thinking about how they can lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d do well to remember who we are when we’re &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in costume. Harder to define, but endless in our multitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We were at the park with our one year old when a man with a scraggly beard and sunglasses approached us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Enjoy these days, when they’re toddling around and cooing at you. Once they’re gone, they’re gone, and they’re &lt;em&gt;never coming back&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember asking him for advice. But this is typical, this need people have to randomly tell me I need to enjoy this moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because they see me with a kid, and they remember their own kids at that age, and they wish they’d been more present, and so they’re, I guess, making up for it by giving me an unsolicited lecture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of life is precious and every moment is worth fully experiencing. Give me an example of a moment that doesn’t need to be fully experienced. The dentist? The grocery line? What makes these moments less valuable than watching our kids on slides and swings? The value we ascribe to the present moment is devised, labeled, and structured only by our own brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present moment can’t be less or more interesting by comparison, because there’s &lt;em&gt;nothing to compare it to&lt;/em&gt; other than memories of the past, or hopes and fears about the future. It’s like comparing the moon to photos of the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a lady once outside the DC metro shouting “everybody! You’ve got time! You’ve got time because you are ALIVE!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a much more useful interruption. Yes, we are alive, and time is on our side if we flow with it instead of against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self talk is necessarily a dangerous habit because if we convince ourselves that we are as bad or good as we think we are, we might actually believe ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or worse, we might become what we believe ourselves to be, an exaggerated and dehydrated and deflated version of the person we really are.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When my son was 5 months old, we unboxed a walker that someone had gifted us. We’d put his little legs through the holes in the walker and then he could stand up right. At the level of his hands were a whole bunch of wheels and knobs that made interesting noises when he twisted and pressed and pulled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d put him in this walker soon after he woke up each day. It’d be his play place while we’d get ready for work, and since he couldn’t really move his feet at the time, it was a perfect way to contain him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;We’d put him in there, and almost immediately he’d furrow his brow and get a curious look on his face, and begin twisting and turning. Watching him do this, my wife and I said it’s almost like he’s at his job. So intent, so passionate, doing his best to get the job done right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone has this type of outlook on their work. In fact, the idea of a cubicle doesn’t make me think of passion and curiosity, but of drudgery, boredom, and clock-watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learn a lot watching my son, who is now just a little over one year old. The way he is in the cubicle is how I aspire to live life all the time: hungry, inquisitive, and driven by joy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To break an old habit, I started replacing “what do you do for a living?” with “what are you excited about?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are surprised when I ask this. It turns out that there are a few people that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; quite excited about their job, and there are many that find their jobs very dull, and their hobbies are really far more interesting. They’ll get eventually get to telling you about them, but I like using the excitement trigger as a way of launching into a conversation with someone new.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The first conversation, that bond that starts a friendship, functions much more efficiently if there’s excitement and passion involved. And if you’re excited about something, chances are your enthusiasm might make &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; excited about that same something, and now we have a deep personal connection, a starting point, a branch that can grow wondrous, beautiful leaves.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, an item that was placed on a very high shelf falls without warning. Nothing seemed to cause the fall. There was no gnome hiding behind the object, no gust of wind, and no invisible hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of thing was once known as a poltergeist: an unexplained occurrence that people would attribute to a supernatural being or a ghost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, what happened was tiny little trembles in the earth that are undetectable to humans made the item on the shelf move forward, micrometers at a time, until it finally got pushed too far over the edge, and it fell. The whole process took months or even years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Humans are like this too. We experience turbulence every single day that shift our us away from our spiritual centers. Let it happen too long and you too will fall off the shelf. I know because I’ve been there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is not to avoid letting circumstances and experiences move us away from our center; it’s to always return to the center no matter how far we’ve strayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a bit like poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a poem, the words are laid out in front of us, and it’s up to us to give them meaning. Sure, the poet may have had their own intentions, but any artist worth their salt knows that their intention is basically a form of trivia and audience interpretation is everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s the tarot too. It’s not the intention of some divine entity to tell us our future, or give us advice. We interpret how the cards fall and make up our own advice, or we have someone else, someone who’s good at feeling energy and interpreting it, do it for us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing divine about it, which makes it entirely divine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have airplane anxiety. I’ve written about it before. I’ve described the different techniques I’ve used to try and get over it. Though my phobia seems to be getting better, I still get uncomfortable when the plane begins to jostle around in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing is that the ride is &lt;em&gt;even bumpier&lt;/em&gt; on the ground before takeoff. And when I’m on the Amtrak, sometimes it’s so bumpy that I get violently thrown against the window next to my seat. Yet these situations never seem to make me uncomfortable at all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And when I’m on the Amtrak, sometimes it’s so bumpy that I get violently thrown against the window next to my seat. Yet these situations never seem to make me uncomfortable at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is quite a mind game, airplane anxiety. The bumps are not what it makes it uncomfortable, clearly, since I can filter them out when I’m on a train or on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the context that scares me. The fear of being in the air, of something that could go wrong, of falling from the sky to my death. The bumps are simply a cue, or a trigger, that activates this habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what else in my life feels uncomfortable but is actually just a &lt;em&gt;trigger&lt;/em&gt; that activates discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Meditation In A Noisy Place</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-09-12-meditation-in-a-noisy-place/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you think of meditation, you probably envision a serene hillside, a quiet butterfly or two, and a person sitting silently, legs crossed, in total perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I meditate in my basement. It’s freezing cold, there is usually at least one cricket on the ground near me, and I sit in front of my TV (turned off). But it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I was meditating with the baby monitor nearby. About 50 seconds in, my son started wailing through the monitor. Since my son is old enough now that I can let him cry for a bit without intervening, I kept on going.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I noticed my thoughts arriving in my head, like I normally do. Most of them were plans for how I was going to make the crying stop, or how long I would wait before I went into his room. My brain immediately went into planning mode, only this time, I was sitting outside of it in meditation, just observing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It surprised me at how immediate my “find a solution” mind went into action, especially with not much of a problem to solve since he does occasionally wake up, cry, and put himself back to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a little bit like how I feel when there’s airplane turbulence. I look out the window, I grip the seat, I turn off my music. None of these things allow me to actually control the situation, but my mind is going into planning mode, and looking for &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; that might help alleviate the suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this anecdote challenges the idea of needing to be in a quiet, comfortable, clean place to meditate. If meditation is simply the act of being aware in the eternal now, then it doesn’t matter how noisy the environment. All of it is part of now, all of it is part of the experience of being human.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most simple questions remains of the most profound mysteries in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are you? I’m fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you’re really thinking about it, really taking every little comment literally, you might get swept up in your own thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could, when someone asks, take mental stock of your mood, your tense body parts, your clenched fists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could, when someone asks, tell them that that you’re somewhere in between hope and fear, that the question is somewhat irrelevant since that’s where all of us are.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Or, you could say nothing at all. And in the silence, you could just continue to ask yourself mentally… how am I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How am I, indeed? How did I come to be? How did this mysterious universe do all of it’s behind-the-scenes magic and here I am, eating Doritos and metacognitively analyzing the whole thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a minute the next someone asks how you are and think about how truly amazing and wondrous that question really is.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cognitive Error</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-09-10-cognitive-error/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been discussed in many books that humans are driven by narrative. That even when we &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; we’re being rational and logical, we’re really just validating the stories we tell ourselves. Data can prove almost anything, it turns out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine once referred to these instances as “cognitive errors.” But to a technologist, an error means that a system didn’t work as designed. But that’s not the case with the brain: it was “designed” to tell stories, to complete narratives. It’s why we find movies and TV and books to be so compelling. It’s a biological instinct that helps us survive: we fill in missing information, and while it is sometimes to our detriment is often a practice that can save us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;And of course, when it comes to technology, there’s also user error: when a system that works as designed is used improperly by a user. Sometimes we experience “user error” with the brain and that’s why meditation is such a useful tool. It helps us understand that we are the user of our brain, and not one with the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s becoming more and more useful to me to think of the brain is a technology. A complex, misunderstood, and mysterious technology, but a technology nonetheless, and one that we could choose to operate manually instead of on auto-pilot.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was 11, I visited my uncle in England. We were moving into his house and he told me he was ordering a new computer. I got really excited to play games on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it arrived, it came in various boxes. It turned out my uncle, to save money, had ordered computer &lt;em&gt;parts&lt;/em&gt;. With very little time to deal with the computer, he tasked me with building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…build a computer?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;“…build a computer?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just put the parts together. Can’t be that hard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waded through the boxes and pulled out foreign looking objects like memory cards and internal hard drives and fans and what not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t quite remember what happened after that. Some force took over, one that I hadn’t experienced before but became addicted to thereafter. It was the feeling of feeling a “flow” mixed in with intense curiosity, persistence, and a glimmer of the beauty of success, somewhere off in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put all the parts together to make a computer and it felt glorious. Not only was the success sweet, but I had learned how to put something complex together. It showed me that it was possible, that there was value in the process. I believe this event woke the DIY demon living dormant in my soul. I have since been addicted to taking complex, seemingly impossible problems… things like writing an app, learning jazz guitar… and breaking them down into modules, and tackling each module with all my might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May we continue to have experiences like this one – ones where the task at hand is so compelling that it drives us &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; crazy enough to be victorious.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Paying Attention</title>

      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we pay someone, we’re handing them currency in exchange for something of equal value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happens then, when we pay attention? We hand over the currency of our awareness, of the present moment. In exchange, we expect something of equal value. In the cases where my attention payment has resulted in something of equal value, I’ve learned a life lesson, or seen something provocative. Something within me has changed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But what happens if we pay for something and get something of lesser value in return? We’d feel ripped off. We’d want our money back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes me wonder why we don’t feel this way when we get low quality content back when we pay our attention to things like social media or the comments section of basically any website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did we get an hour, or whatever time we spent, worth of value back in return? I can think of very few times Facebook provided this kind of return and even less examples of Twitter. YouTube, on occasion. Podcasts, more frequently than anything else but those are slightly more reliable at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I place the value of attention above any other currency, including money and even time. We all have roughly the same amount of time, and if we have less than someone else it’s usually out of our control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we don’t “spend” time – time spends us. The only thing we have to give is our attention. Let’s invest mindfully instead of spending frivolously.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sounds Of The Metro</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“I guess we have to stop talking now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the only words on an album I made called Lines, along with my friend Scott Colman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days before we made this recording, we were going to a concert on the metro. After some conversation, we stopped talking and sat in silence for a few moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During those moments, I unexpectedly got absorbed in the sounds that I was hearing: the hum of the doors opening and closing, the soft clank of the machinery on the train, the gentle voice on the speaker telling us what the next stop would be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Scott was having the same experience sitting next to me, and at some point we turned to each other and realized that we needed to make a recording of the sounds using a high quality battery powered microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we did, and I later overlaid ambient guitar sounds and synths on top of it to make our album called &lt;a href=&#34;https://smallspaces.bandcamp.com/album/lines&#34;&gt;Lines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been into albums like these at the time, which buck convention. One of them was simply some recordings of a pool hall, with many of the mid frequencies stripped away. The result was delightful, at least to me. Most people I played it for didn’t understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What these albums are, both in creating them and listening to them, is simply an act of awareness. These are the sounds that fade into the background of our daily experience. When we bring them to the forefront, the result can be magical.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Battle Scars</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I moved into my house last year, I scratched one of my nice guitars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t a small, inconspicuous scratch either. It was right in the most visible part of the guitar. It wasn’t cool looking either; it looked like a mistake rather than some wear after years of playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I struggled with this event for quite a while. I knew that the mark itself didn’t make the guitar any less worthy of being played, and I certainly wasn’t about to buy a new guitar over this scratch, and yet… it was troubling for a reason that I couldn’t place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;With a little bit of time and reflection, I think the feelings I had were about perfection. Specifically, the idea that I can’t be happy unless everything looks, feels, and acts the way I want it to. A guitar should be pristine, I believed. So a blemish is stressful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I was able to keep playing and enjoying the guitar anyway. Time passed, and someone even pointed out the scratch to me at one point, and I had forgotten about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is, I didn’t need to struggle with this at all. There wasn’t much I could’ve done about the scratch. And as many musicians argue, a guitar is &lt;em&gt;meant&lt;/em&gt; to be damaged. It means that it’s being used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same could be said for people. We’re meant to be damaged, meant to be used up until our very last breath. Battle scars, they’re called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pain that I put myself through over something that couldn’t be reversed (at least without a professional luthier) was unnecessary. How much other pain in my life is unnecessary this way? Pain that seems perfectly valid in the moment but is caused by damage that was meant to happen at some point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s more than I think, probably. Maybe all of the suffering is unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe every scar is a battle scar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I worked at a desk and did tasks that didn’t require much cognitive effort, I used to listen to the latest tunes on KCRW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I became a teacher, and the types of things I’d have to write were more cognitively demanding, I moved to instrumental music. Something about lyrics seems to draw me in, and even in a subconscious way distracts me from the work I’m supposed to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;These days, my days are filled with writing my new book, this blog, my journal… all require me to be able to access ideas and thoughts easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even instrumental music these days has become distracting. Moving melody lines, beautiful harmonies… all of this is engaging, and draws me in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I have a new strategy: listening to ambient sound recordings. A calm lake, a beach, the ocean, a rainforest… there’s nothing to “follow” and these environments just take me in. I find that I can melt into them and write for hours. Brian Eno’s music is also like this, though there are few artists that do it like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson: the backdrop you create for yourself matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think kids should be able to watch TV. And a lot of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Netflix or an iPad device that allows them to pick any channel and binge the same TV show for hours like a monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I mean TV. Passing, fleeting, TV. The type where you can’t choose what will be shown, the kind where you have to make it a priority, the kind that teaches you lessons about life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite shows, Hey Dude, taught me a lot of life lessons. I acquired these pieces of wisdom throughout the show’s 65 episodes that I religiously videotaped every time they were on. I learned about how and why to keep a secret, why it’s silly to have a battle of the sexes, how parents worry about their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are lessons I may not have received in other forms. Or at least not as directly as I got from this Nickelodeon show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents used to say that sitting so close to the TV would ruin my eyes, but I think it has helped me to see more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The philosopher/entertainer Alan Watts describes experiencing the present moment as a process of “coming to your senses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard that phrase used before to “snap” people out of whatever delusion they’re in. &lt;em&gt;What are you doing?? Don’t walk near the cliff! Come to your senses!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we dive in deep to this saying, we realize that it’s a reminder, either from ourselves or from another person, to use our five senses to reconnect with reality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;When I took a course on the fear of flying years ago, one of the strategies they recommend when your mind is spiraling out of control during turbulence is to name one thing you can see, one you can touch, one you can hear, one you can smell, and so on. Just acknowledging these sensory objects brings us back into the present moment and away from the story our brain is telling about the plane falling from the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So meditators will sniff incense, listen to gongs, touch their hands together, and taste tea. I’ve heard of meditation before using sight, too, but it seems easier to me with the other senses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the next time you need to come to your senses, you simply find the nearest sensory object and welcome it into your attention. Now you’ve redirected, and you can take another step.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Persona</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-09-02-a-persona/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My best friend in eighth grade claimed that he could adopt anyone’s personality. He claimed that if he spent enough time around someone, their quirks and mannerisms would rub off, and that he’d acquire some of their being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use the term &lt;em&gt;persona&lt;/em&gt; sometimes to describe the way a person acts, the general flavor of their jokes and conversations. If someone adopts a new persona, it usually means that they are adopting a character, the way that Steven Colbert used to do on the Colbert Report.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If someone adopts a new persona, it usually means that they are adopting a character, the way that Steven Colbert used to do on the Colbert Report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Watts tells us that a &lt;em&gt;persona&lt;/em&gt; translates to “mask.” And that the word &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt;, of course, comes from persona. This person we think we are is actually a mask. And every single conversations becomes a performance, an evolution of this character that we’ve created. It’s not a negative thing because it’s the only way we can communicate. Silly as it is, Ben Stein’s insights about this topic in the Jim Carrey classic “The Mask” actually contain some wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Interesting to note that Jim Carrey is now obsessed with the idea of dropping his ego. Celebrities are more prone to this than most people since their persona is compounded by the public’s perception.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But knowing this fact liberates us. We are not the masks, or the personas, that we wear. Whenever we get sucked into thinking we are, we’re deluding ourselves and setting ourselves up for potential suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one that’s behind the mask is always there, easily accessible but hard to locate. Call it the soul, the spirit, the eyes that see, your face before you were born. Others can connect to it, but can’t describe it in words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words are for personas, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How To Feel Better</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This isn’t about mood, or even wellness. It’s about the skill of &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt;. How do we improve how we go about feeling?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we hold an object, our skin is exposed to it, and we feel it automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also hold memories, experiences, happenings, and ideas. We can feel them, touch their ridges, rub their rough surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But feeling better happens when we put the thing down. After we feel it, we go back to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; feeling it. We can remember that we felt it without needing to recreate the experience mentally or physically.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;They say the grass is greener on the other side of the fence. What they don’t talk about is what happens when you end up on the other side of the fence. Yes, it’s implied that eventually the grass seems greener on the side you left, but there’s something even more ponderous at play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grass that you migrated to is now ubiquitous: what was once interesting and colorful and attractive now blends into the background. Once the novelty is gone, all you’re left with is what you’ve always had: your flaws, your anxieties, your joys, and your fears.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it’s better not to go where the grass is greener, but where it’s more sparse, where it covers less of the earth, where it reveals instead of conceals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Star Wars, Yoda teaches Luke to control his power. Harry Potter is also trainer by his mentors. The ninja turtles turn to their sensei Splinter when they are out of control, and he grounds them with his calm and poised nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching and training is always like this. There’s no way to transmit knowledge as far as I know. The best we can do is assume our learners already have everything they need as beginners: curiosity, passion, and perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On Being Reliable</title>

&lt;p&gt;Many people make it a goal to be more reliable. To be the kind of person that can be trusted, one that keeps promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we practice this? It’s not as easy as it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find myself more reliable in the last few years than I’ve ever been before. I can tell because people in my life trust me to complete important projects and tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But the interesting part is that I haven’t tried to become a more reliable person to others. Instead, I’ve been working on &lt;em&gt;self reliance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t been trying to keep promises to others as much as I have been trying to keep promises to myself. And the most essential part of that process is deciding what promises to make to myself. If I constantly think about what promises I’ve made to everyone else, I end up feeling aimless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cultivate my own values this way and tune into my inner voice. The by product is that I’m now seen as more reliable to others as an unintended but welcome result.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Bell Directs Our Attention</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When a group of meditators in the Zen tradition meet at a temple to practice together, the meditation usually starts by the leader hitting a gong or a bell of some kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not only a signal that the group will start meditating soon, but it is also a way of directing attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attention, the most important part of meditation, wanders away quite quickly. Using the five senses, we can channel our attention back to the present moment. It’s why we use incense, or why powerpoint is engaging. The bell is another way to activate the senses and bring us back to the present.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Facebook uses a bell icon to notify us that we have new messages. Most of the social apps also use the striking color red to show us when we have new notifications, because red creates a sense of urgency (it’s a color that’s frequently used for emergencies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the bell in meditation brings us into the present moment with nothing to do be with ourselves, then the bell on Facebook directs our attention to all of the stories of the friends we follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, these two bells are polar opposites: one restricts our attention, the other allows it to wander.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 Things Ive Learned About Parenting In Year 1</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-08-27-5-things-ive-learned-about-parenting-in-year-1/</link>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No one knows &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;. The journey of being a parent is a series of questions and half-answers that barely satisfy. It’s unique to every person. It can’t be any other way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I used to think of love as something special, an action you take to connect with someone on an intimate level. I’m starting to think that it’s an endless stream hidden by a curtain, and you can bathe in it anytime you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hearing your kid cry is hard. So many big emotions, with so few skills in dealing with them. But this is life now. My kid will probably always have a lack of skills to deal with life’s challenges. So will I.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I want to survive the emotional turmoil of being the parent then I have to freeze time. I have to learn how to experience the eternal now. If all time is &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, then there’s nothing to miss. Another way of saying it: children &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Manhood-Amateurs-Pleasures-Regrets-Husband/dp/0061490199/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2J53AABTKUG1Y&amp;keywords=manhood+for+amateurs&amp;qid=1566954857&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=manhood+for+ama%2Caps%2C120&amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;bend space and time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My relationship with my child is intertwined in my relationship with everyone else, including those who aren’t around anymore, and including myself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is there anything more glorious than a seed? A tiny, rounded, object that goes into the ground and produces an entire forest. Sometimes, I’ll eat sunflower seeds and I’ll forget, conveniently, that each one contains the &lt;em&gt;possibility&lt;/em&gt; of an entire sunflower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve never watched a flower grow in slow motion. But I imagine it’s a lot like watching a child grow. Children seem to bend space and time, growing slowly a little bit every day, but &lt;em&gt;transforming&lt;/em&gt; as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It’s so overwhelming that it’s easy to want to distract ourselves from thinking about it. But then we miss everything. And the only antidote that works is celebrating the seed and its infinite possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m addicted to researching topics on the internet. If I’m going through something (fatherhood, an illness, buying a car), I soak up as much information as possible from people on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anecdotal stories about how to sleep train, and what nutritional plan works best are helpful because they let me zoom in on actual stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General data is perhaps more helpful though, since it’s gathered scientifically (usually). Seeing the big picture can often make individual stories less relevant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;General data is perhaps more helpful though, since it’s gathered scientifically (usually). Seeing the big picture can often make individual stories less relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s a problem with using general data to solve specific problems: our problems are unique to our lives and our world views, so general data becomes useless. It could cause extra worry, in fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And those anecdotals are also useless, since one person’s story and lessons learned are far different from their neighbor’s stories and lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better strategy is to learn to listen to our own intuition. It takes practice and stillness. Our own life data and observations are more relevant and useful than anything else on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m fascinated by popular phrases, especially ones that reveal interesting qualities about humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the phrase “I’m not crying, you’re crying!” Is posted on videos that are heartwarming and touching, as a way for the person to get off the hook for feeling anything. The phrase detracts and devalues from the content that is truly heartwarming. It also devalues wonder, sadness, or whatever emotion caused the tears in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I know that sounds harsh. And I know people that post this common phrase aren’t emotionally stunted or anything like that. But I think the fact that a phrase like this becomes popular to begin with speaks volumes about how unwilling we are to just admit to &lt;em&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say: let every song, movie, story, and place in the world move us to tears, and let’s be completely honest about it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Longform Vs Shortform Posts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I feel like a capped fountain if I’m not writing daily. Another reason I write is because it’s a great way to ponder the mysteries of life. Writing and publishing can cause all sorts of healing. It’s thrilling when someone is affected by what you write, even if it’s just one person.&lt;/p&gt;

On a social media site like Facebook, everyone is watching and so it makes sense to write knowing that hundreds of people might immediately be exposed to your work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;I feel like a capped fountain if I’m not writing daily. Another reason I write is because it’s a great way to ponder the mysteries of life. Writing and publishing can cause all sorts of healing. It’s thrilling when someone is affected by what you write, even if it’s just one person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I mean this specifically with writing long form articles/posts on a blog (not a social media site). On a social media site like Facebook, everyone is watching and so it makes sense to write knowing that hundreds of people might immediately be exposed to your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on a blog like this one, there’s a smaller audience. Some of my posts get 1-2 reads and I love that. It means that I can write from the heart and not worry about editing it to suit the tastes of dozens of my random friends and acquaintances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It definitely beats Twitter, or short-form posting. I’ve realized in the last few years that the character limit, for certain issues, really becomes a barrier to conversation. Tweets are just as their name suggests – quick, sharp, high-pitched, many-at-once, and meaningless. At least to humans. To birds, tweeting isn’t called tweeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes with shorter form content, it’s like pouring a tiny drop onto the sidewalk on a hot summer day. With long form content, we pour water into a container big enough to express our thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>If You Are Ready To Go Home</title>

&lt;p&gt;A common message that we heard from our parents and teachers growing up is &lt;em&gt;never give up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the movie Moana, this conventional wisdom is reversed in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://nrgburst.tumblr.com/post/160101786140/i-need-to-talk-about-this-scene-because-its-so&#34;&gt;subtle moment&lt;/a&gt; toward the end of the film. There’s a scene in Moana where she feels like giving up and she confronts the spirit of her grandmother to seek advice. Normally in these situations, especially in kids movies, the wise old sage will tell the warrior not to give up. But Moana’s grandmother doesn’t do this; instead, she says “If you are ready to go home, I will be with you.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Maybe our parents believe they owe their success to never giving up, but let’s be honest with ourselves: &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; feels like giving up sometimes. And &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; has given up on various projects or activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we didn’t connect to our original goal anymore, like an aspiring musician who realized that they were tired of chasing the dream, or perhaps they’ve grown up, like a kid who wants to be a veterinarian until they discover the joy of programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving up is important and necessary. The question is: if you know someone who is giving up, will you empower them by standing by their decision?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I really discovered Reddit a few years ago, I quickly learned how it provides value. This was a service that segmented by interest, and I could find communities around almost anything that fascinated me. Here, in this corner of the internet, were crazy people like myself, obsessed over plant based diets, fitness regimens, meditation, and to-do list managers. We could all sit together in a hot tub of our fandom, discussing every single last niche of our chosen universe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;When I really discovered Reddit a few years ago, I quickly learned how it provides value. This was a service that segmented by interest, and I could find communities around almost anything that fascinated me. Here, in this corner of the internet, were crazy people like myself, obsessed over plant based diets, fitness regimens, meditation, and to-do list managers. We could all sit together in a hot tub of our fandom, discussing every single last niche of our chosen universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s a dark side to being able to access a community of people interested in a micro-market, which is that we tend to get a bit obsessive. If you’ve ever been on the mechanical keyboards subreddit, you know that those folks encourage each other to spend a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of money on mechanical keyboards. The same goes for any expensive hobby – the cheap stuff won’t do, because we’re &lt;em&gt;fanatics&lt;/em&gt; here. If you’re serious about your photography for instance, you’re going to need the highest quality equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; gets dicey. If you’ve ever seen an internet community argue over which guitar in a shoot-out sounds “warmer” then you know what I’m talking about. It goes on forever, and isn’t actually helpful to those looking to buy a guitar; rather, it serves as an almost masturbatory reflex for the super fans. We share our thoughts and seem like the experts we are, and in return, the person who wanted to know which guitar sounds sweeter was convince not to listen to their own voice, which is the first voice they heard when they heard the instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing to deep dive but there’s a problem with becoming obsessive over a topic. Especially with greedy companies looking to capitalize on your fascination with, say, journaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure how far this problem will go as the years move on and technology’s capabilities grow. And I’m not sure I want to know.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Choose Your Own Adventure series isn’t as popular these days as it was when I was a kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The library used to be flooded with these books. You could make choices about the plot and read the book non-linearly to have an adventure. The stories were captivating too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a teacher, I made sure that these books had a place in my classroom. Though I advertised them as “ video games in the form of books,” these books taught a secondary and profound lesson.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Each door we choose to open, each person we choose to speak with, each step, each breath… the sum of all of it is an adventure that we get to craft ourselves. Our story is unique and beautiful simply because of the autonomy we have in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while you can’t ever forget a storyline, it’s possible to begin again at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all create art, whether we admit to it or not. Perhaps your art is your fine art, or perhaps it’s your children, or perhaps it’s your cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we look at it this way, it’s easy to get offended when others don’t like or connect to our art. We get defensive, and we start to question our abilities as an artist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;There’s a simple solution, which is to write it on our hands that we are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; our art. Yes, we might spend our time to creating an expressions of our inner world, but this is the same thing as hating a picture of a tree and somehow believing you also hate the tree itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it doesn’t matter what other people think. We’re still great, fresh, thinking, creative, and agile. And the effect that our art has on people will be what it is, and that’s why we made it. Even if the effect is one of disgust or indifference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you really dig deep, it’s possible to realize that we don’t make things so that people will love them. No one has ever made anything that is truly universally loved. After all there, are even 1-star reviews for Goodnight Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we make things for people to see, hear, and dance to. And for people to kick to the curb if they want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has nothing do with character or moral judgment. I do not hold my work accountable. If someone somewhere &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt; something as a result of the things I made, good or bad, I have done my job.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Art Of The Quick Purge</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I was building my recording studio in my early 20’s, it felt like I bought a new microphone every day. Not just microphones in fact, but pre-amps, software, headphones, guitars, and other various tools that I could use to make music. I’d buy some stuff, figure out it wasn’t for me, and then sell it on eBay or another site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People thought I was crazy. Of course, I rarely re-sold these items for more or equal to what I paid, so what was the point? Surely the difference between two high quality microphones wasn’t that big. Also, when would I stop this cycle and just be happy with what I have?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I pondered the same questions that my friends and family were asking me. But eventually, I found the right set of gear. I’m not sure if I just grew out of the habit of buying new stuff, or I had just finally found a set up that worked for me, but either way, I was set. I haven’t bought another piece of music gear (other than as a replacement for something that broke) in over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process of quick purging also led me to the right computer keyboard when I was on the search for a new mechanical keyboard to write my book. I went through 4 different keyboards to find the right one. And though I experienced a number of amazing keyboards, the one that I originally thought would have the least appeal is the one that I went with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a technologists so I place a lot of importance on the type of tools that I’m using. Better to lose money re-selling something that doesn’t work than to be stuck with with a less-than-sufficient tool just because you bought it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the muse hits us, when we come up with a stroke of genius, we often describe the feeling as &lt;em&gt;inspiration&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspire literally means to breathe something in. We see something in culture that we take in, that finds its way into the crevices in our bones, that changes our brain chemistry (even a little).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We say “I’ve been inspired” when that happens.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But what happens next is the action we take, the book we write, the song we compose, And that is when we aspire, which literally means to breathe out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is composed of this in/out breath, literally. And creating art is what we &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; do when we’re inspired, or else we might &lt;em&gt;expire&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m fascinated by environments that contain tiny little worlds. Places like restaurants, where each booth contains a different group of oeople, a different story, one that is entirely different from the story of those in the booth just one over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College dorms are like this too, except a little more specialized. Take a bunch of people who were children yesterday and expected to be adults today, pair them up with another random person in the same situation, and see what happens. Each form has &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; tiny worlds inside. Sometimes the split is visible when you look inside.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness, meditation, thought-naming… whatever you want to call it, is a little bit like playing tennis with your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world without mindfulness (which I live in about 99% of the time), It’s as if my mind is constantly serving me tennis balls. I let the balls hit my body, and then I cry for a while over the pain. Being pelted with tennis balls for most of the week means being tired and worn out on the weekends. It means staying inside and watching Netflix instead of being out on the court.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But mindfulness and meditation shows me that there’s a racket sitting next to me on the court. And I can pick it up and swat those tennis balls right back to my opponent, the amygdala or lizard brain, that is constantly pelting me with hard rubber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t need to be aggressive either. If you’ve ever played tennis, you’ll know that it takes very little force to swat a ball back as long as you are holding the racket correctly. The ball kind of glides right off the racket and back across the net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s what mindfulness can be: enjoying the process of the gentle swatting of thoughts back over the net, over and over, with no end in sight.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Years ago, I made a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA-zPVzUPa8&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; with my friend about tea ceremonies. I was fascinated by his tea process, the way that he would strain the tea leaves over and over, creating a new “steep” each time. The hot water would run through the tea, extracting new textures, flavors, and colors until eventually the leaves too shriveled to produce anything worth tasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, we compared this process to friendship, and how different iterations or steeps could produce vastly different relationships and results. And now, I think about this with raising my child.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;My wife and I often marvel at the fact that we thought our son was cute as a newborn. He was cute, but not anywhere near as cute as he is now. He went through a “steep” of his own, and new colors and flavors were reveled. And every day, he continues to unfurl like a flower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in order to steep, you need to be doused in hot water. Heat causes expansion. And we can’t forget about this fact in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain leads to revival, for babies and adults. If we don’t feel brave enough to sit in hot water and steep, we won’t grow either.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure where I first heard this idea or where it came from, but it really spoke to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a teacher, I used to tell my students that anger was an emotion, just like the all the rest. But in my 30’s, I’m realizing that it’s a little bit more dangerous than other emotions. With anger, it’s easy to hit a wall. To slam face first and then not be able to recover for a while. Other emotions can be a little bit more subtle, gentle perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But if anger sends us flying toward the ground from an airplane, then curiosity is the parachute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is curiosity if it isn’t a simple pause between us and our emotions? We can sit on the park bench and wonder for a while, we can avoid colliding with things, we can just simply be aware of what’s in front of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t be mad if you’re curious in the same way that you can’t clench your teeth wearing a night guard. The muscle has no room to contract. To be angry puts our heart into a box, but to wonder and be curious puts us our heart on a hillside, staring into the infinite.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To express stress about the overwhelming and sometimes scary world that we live in, there are a couple of phrases I’ve heard people use. One is &lt;em&gt;it’s a jungle out there,&lt;/em&gt; which usually means that the world is too crazy to really understand, and we should resign ourselves to that fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also heard the term &lt;em&gt;it’s a circus&lt;/em&gt;, which is the same idea with a bit more chaos thrown in for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;These phrases are sometimes used in an exasperated way, when the world has gotten a hold of our heart and won’t let go. We exclaim them when we walk through the door after a long day. We use them to describe chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a jungle and circus are actually both organized systems. They may be more complex than other systems and have many moving parts, but they are systems nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A jungle functions in a particular, despite the fact that we have to use blades to cut through it. Circus owners plan every last detail to create an illusion of chaos and discord (which in turn creates excitement).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are most stressed by the systems that we haven’t taken the time to understand and that are so dense it’s hard to move through them. They &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; like they are a blob of chaos and disorganization, but they’re actually a balancing act of nature and nurture.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stay Curious</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When my son was born, I had a mantra that I said to him every night before he went to sleep. It was &lt;em&gt;stay curious&lt;/em&gt;. I think Steve Jobs said it once in a graduation speech. My hope was that he would grow up to be someone who questioned the world, who made predictions, and who solve problems driven by this intense curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back on it, I realize now that this mantra was less for him than it was for me. I’m the one who needed to remain curious, in a very curious time in my life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I think about it now as I play with him on the weekends. He’s curious naturally, I don’t need to remind him. But me? My mind can drift in all sorts of directions when I should be focusing on enjoying the precious time we have together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days when I tuck him in, I say the mantra, but I say it so that both of us can hear it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Please Rt</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a common phrase on Twitter about a decade ago when Twitter was at its prime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conventional wisdom was that you won’t go viral, you won’t be re-tweeted, you won’t be shared… &lt;em&gt;unless you ask for it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were floods of tweets that ended with PLEASE RT promoting all sorts of things: ideas, music, stories, news articles…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another manifestation of this same disease is the common “Hit Like and Subscribe” when you watch a YouTube video.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I suspect the people that do the re-tweeting and re-sharing because they were asked are doing so because they want to build social capital. Because when they themselves have something to promote later on, the people whom they supported will return the favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of content, the stuff promoted out of an expected reciprocal share, won’t go anywhere. It isn’t remarkable work. It is the residue of the attempt at a promotional partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does get shared is work that is compelling. Artists, activists, and others who want to get their voice heard would be better served by honing their craft than by begging for attention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Terse Recipe Card</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I became a cook in my late 20’s. Someone had given me a card for the company Hello Fresh, which at the time was just starting out with their meal delivery kits. I got a free trial and never looked back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meal delivery took everything I hated out of the cooking process; mostly, going to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ziahassan.com/daily/on-grocery-stores/&#34;&gt;grocery store&lt;/a&gt; and measuring things out. After a few years of using the service every week, I felt like I could basically cook anything, even if I didn’t have a great sense of flavor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t help but notice, though, the terse way in which recipes were written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stir the noodles. Drain the pot. Rougly chop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare this to the food bloggers who tell their life story before getting to the recipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But old school recipe cards weren’t made to teach people how to cook; they were meant to jog the memory. A &lt;em&gt;record&lt;/em&gt; of something that was once improvisatory art, like documenting the musical notes after you’ve developed the piece from scratch. It’s a reminder of that which we already know, an experience which can’t and shouldn’t be decorated with any extra imagery or descriptive language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recipe card is a map of the place we’ve already been. A recording of the concert that we experienced. Reading a card with instructions can’t re-construct the experience of eating and enjoying life, but it can show our footprints in the sand.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Another Bubble</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I told a friend of mine that I was visiting a place called Pokomoke City for work. He looked it up on his phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wow, that’s way out there,” he said. “But I always think it’s good to visit another place that’s far away. You know, to talk to the people there, so you don’t get too wrapped up in your own bubble.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s true that the people that live in my hometown of DC &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; living in a bubble. It feels like everyone is liberal, everyone hates Trump… because most people here are and do. But this bubble is also self conscious. We will be the first to point out that not everyone in the country thinks like we do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The trick is that &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; lives in a bubble. Scientists can predict someone’s beliefs based on where they live. Our environment becomes the air that we breathe, air that becomes part of us, hanging out in between our molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone thinks like me, but everyone lives in a bubble, like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have that in common, at least.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Scribbling It Out</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I write a lot, and I always have. I prefer word processing to handwriting usually, because I get annoyed at how much I scribble over things when I write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t use an eraser, even if I’m using a pencil. What’s the point? An eraser is for school children turning their work in to a teacher. It makes the page cleaner but it gives the illusion of perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at any of my old notebooks or index cards and you’ll find more scribbles than words. I’m no longer annoyed by this; it’s part of the process. To not scribble would require producing perfect writing on the first try, and that would require fooling myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The only reason you don’t see scribbles on this blog is because I typed it. But while I was typing it, I was deleting and moving more words than you can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scribbles represent the act of filtering, of the editing process. And that is a process that provides the most clarity and value, more than even the ideas being edited.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Time Is Evening</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It used to make me feel awkward whenever I would leave the office at 4pm and my boss would say, “have a good evening!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it evening at 4pm? I was under the impression it was still afternoon. This memory inspires the question: when exactly is the evening?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my mind, it’s always been pretty straightforward: anytime between the time you wake up and noon is the morning, noon to 4 is the afternoon, 4-6 is the late afternoon, 6-9 is the evening, and after 9 up to when you go to bed is definitely night.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A quick Google search reveals that the answer varies, but seems to hover around 5 or 6 for the start of the evening. Some say it’s right around sunset, which makes sense in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I suppose, it’s more about the &lt;em&gt;zeitgeist&lt;/em&gt; of evening. If you’re in Alaska and it’s 11pm, the sun is still out and lighting up the rivers where the fly fishers do their work. Can we really call this night, despite the time being 11pm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, if you wake up to go to the bathroom at 4am in Alaska, it’s partially light outside, so much so that the residents there use blackout curtains to make sure they can sleep. I wouldn’t say it’s the night, in this case it’s the early morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s subjective, clearly. But these parts of the day that we name are a bit like the way we label our moods with words: a shoddy indicator for something that is inexplicable yet widely understood.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What I Learned From Staycation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’re unaware, a staycation is a vacation where you don’t vacate – you stay at home and either enjoy low key activities or explore the city in which you live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife and I decided to do one recently. During that time we went kayaking, bought a new car, saw a movie in theaters, planned for our son’s birthday party and much more. The extra time to reflect was beneficial and taught me a lot of lessons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The biggest lesson I got from staycation is that staycation is always available. After all, there wasn’t anything special happening during the week we took off. At any time in the work week, we can take a moment to break a pattern, to connect with something calming and peaceful, or to just sit and &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same things applies to the present moment which is something that I’ve learned through meditation. It’s always available if you ever need it. And really, what more could you need?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In Defense Of Memorization</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-08-03-in-defense-of-memorization/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to criticize modern education for focusing too much on memorization over critical thinking skills. When people hear about kids memorizing the state capitals, the comments that emerge are always something about how students should be taught &lt;em&gt;think critically&lt;/em&gt; and that modern education is the equivalent of a collection of trivia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This argument is partially true. While things are rapidly changing, many students are subjected every day to the memorization of facts masquerading as knowledge. I’ve written before about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ziahassan.com/daily/to-be-smart/&#34;&gt;what it means to be smart&lt;/a&gt;, and it really has nothing to do with facts at all, or even critiquing text.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Still, there is something to be said for memorization, even the rote kind of memorization. Many tech gurus who speak about education argue that since we can look up anything we want on the internet, we shouldn’t need to memorize anything anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is value in memorization. Yes, a computer may be able to retrieve information with relative speed, but if you’ve ever tried a more complicated memorization (like memorizing a stack of 52 playing cards), you know that your brain can retrieve information much more quickly than a human can using a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memorization isn’t necessarily useful in and of itself unless you’re a contestant on Jeopardy, But if you are trying to solve a complex problem, as a lawyer let’s say, and you’ve memorized the key laws for your specialization, it’s very likely that you’ll be much quicker to solve a problem than someone who has to rely on a computer to look it up. Another example is teaching students to memorize their multiplication facts. There are fun ways to get the memorization done, but ultimately it comes down to just knowing what 4×6 is without needing to do any sort of calculation, mental or on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can create a more efficient system if we encourage memorization of the &lt;em&gt;building blocks&lt;/em&gt; to solve a problem, but then spend &lt;em&gt;most of our time&lt;/em&gt; giving kids practice using those blocks to solve complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most amazing examples of fear based motivation was at my orthodontist’s office when I had braces as a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These appointments would consist of approximately 60 minutes of waiting time (which meant lots of Archie comics), a 20 minute adjustment, and then the orthodontist would come out and ask me to bite a lot and then send me on my way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;These appointments would consist of approximately 60 minutes of waiting time (which meant lots of Archie comics), a 20 minute adjustment, and then the orthodontist would come out and ask me to bite a lot and then send me on my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went through a few appliances at this place: a retainer, headgear, braces, and eventually a permanent retainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And every single time I went, the doctor would require us to brush our teeth in a public sink before we came in for the adjustments. We each had our own cubby and special toothbrush too. He had a timer there, so that we could time out 2 minutes before returning to the waiting room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on the wall that you had to look at while you were brushing, were &lt;em&gt;hundreds&lt;/em&gt; of photos of disgusting, gnarly, broken mouths. I mean, mouths where the teeth had gigantic holes in them, where the decay was so bad that you could actually see rotting nerves. It was &lt;em&gt;horrendous.&lt;/em&gt; And you could see all of this while you brushed your teeth. There was no mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, I assumed that what was shown in the photos would happen to me if I didn’t brush. There wasn’t any sort of explanatory plaque with the photos, they just kind of sat there on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No dentist had ever motivated me like this guy. Those other dentists had yelled at me every time I came in, telling me how bad it was not to brush properly…which made me annoyed but not scared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at my orthodontist, I was terrified. Fear is a powerful motivator whether we like it or not. In this case, I had encountered an adult creatively and visually activating my fear to protect me from a future of poor dental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ziahassan.com/daily/on-root-canals/&#34;&gt;still had problems later on&lt;/a&gt;, but it wasn’t his fault.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my third birthday, after getting terrified by a gigantic mouse at Chuck E Cheese, I came home to open presents. The first gift I unwrapped was a camera. It was a fisher price one that actually used film, and I didn’t care about any other gifts after I opened that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I was so obsessed was because my dad had a camera. I saw him use it all the time and I was fascinated by it. So fascinated that my parents got me one of my own. I still remember not understanding that film could be exposed, and ruining my first set of photos by excitedly opening the back compartment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2019. My son is obsessed with wanting to touch my phone and at first, I wondered why. Did he inherently know how magical this device was, how life changing it is for society?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably not. It’s more likely that his obsession is rooted in &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; obsession. Like me watching my dad use his camera, my actions with my phone communicate to him that this is an item that I treasure. If it scares me that he’s already so obsessed over a phone as an 11 month old, then it should scare me even more that he learned that from &lt;em&gt;me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a powerful reminder that children learn by watching our cues. Parenting is, at its core, an examination of our own habits and obsessions. We must shape our own lives in the same way that we’d like to shape theirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of his lectures, Alan Watts points out the value of the word Om.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think chanting was silly, and things like the singing bowl has been categorized as “props” for meditation. But props can be useful. Props are what connect practice to reality, in some ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of Om, as Watts puts it, is that it uses all of the different parts of your mouth to make it, from the back of your throat (Auuuu) to your lips (mmm). And when you hold on the last phoneme of the word, the “mmm” of Om, your nose and sinuses start to shake. And it’s the most wonderful feeling in the world, just to let the inside of your face &lt;em&gt;ring&lt;/em&gt; like it’s singing the song of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Like the Neti pot of meditation, humming or saying Om means nothing. And that’s fine, because it doesn’t have to mean anything to sound good. Like how Brian Eno composed Music for Airports for a functional reason (to have music that could be played in an airport) rather than a semantic reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everything is vibrating all the time, then Om is the square of those vibrations. Or perhaps it’s an antenna that lets us feel the movement of the planet in a manageable way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Two Noticings About Hyperscheduling</title>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-07-28-two-noticings-about-hyperscheduling/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One trend in productivity right now is hyperscheduling, which means to plan your day hour by hour. The idea is that it’s easier to stick to your tasks and habits if they’re on some kind of calendar. People who use systems like these also tend to schedule their free time activities too, like watching TV or reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds over the top, but it works. And the structure, for some, gives the day a feeling of completeness in a modern age where days never feel complete (like scrolling through an endless feed…)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Two noticings about hyperscheduling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vacations from hyperscheduling are wonderful. The structure is necessary for me, but when I get to have an unstructured day, it’s a blessing. But only &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of the contrast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I rarely stick to my day perfectly as scheduled. It doesn’t matter. It’s more about the habit of thinking through the day than it is about being vigilant. Even without perfection, the system has many benefits.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Least Favorite Part Of A Cold</title>

&lt;p&gt;There are many phases to a cold. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the raw and sore throat that makes you want to turn off swallowing for a while&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the faint cough that precedes the onslaught&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the drippy nose faucet that turns on and off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the blockage that seems to only occur in one nostril, that can be controlled with gravity or turning your head to the side in bed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the aches and the pains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the way it starts hurting to blow your nose because of how raw the skin inside is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the endless coughing fits that persist weeks after the actual virus goes away&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is my least favorite? It’s hard to pick. But if I had to pick, it’d be the feeling that is inherent to the entire process, the feeling that this will never go away, that I’m destined to live with this cold for the rest of my life. It’s the feeling of regret, of looking back to when I was healthy just a few days ago, with a feeling of longing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Emotional Gtd</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I came up with this idea years ago, and others have also written about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Getting Things Done methodology, the way that we work is by collecting all the junk in our lives into a list called “Inbox.” Once we collect everything, from the tasks that require a few minutes of time, to larger and more gargantuan tasks like buying a house or writing a thesis, we can then do the step of GTD known as processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In the processing step, we decide where all of these items will go, and they how they might break down. The &lt;em&gt;buy a house&lt;/em&gt; task might break down into 30 different steps (we call this breakability factor a &lt;em&gt;project&lt;/em&gt;), each with their own sub-steps. But the key is that the very &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; action then becomes the thing you target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buy a house&lt;/em&gt; as a project might spur the next action of “visit 3 open houses.” Which is much easier than the task of buying a house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But an interesting thing that you start finding as you “process” your inbox is that some of the things you write don’t have a next action. Maybe you can’t do it right now, or it’s not relevant for your life, or you just want to defer it until later. The items that aren’t relevant, or that don’t make much sense when you think about them for a bit, you can just cross off your list. Then they’re out of mind, and you don’t have to worry about them anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t it be nice to do this for emotions and feelings as well? With Emotional GTD, you’d keep a running list of all your feelings, worries, anxieties, emotions. Then, you’d go through the list and create a “next action” for each item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m worried about being on time for my meeting tomorrow since it’s far away” might translate into “I’ll get my stuff ready the night before so I can leave a bit earlier without compromising sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m worried my kid hates me” might translate into “set up a meeting to discuss feelings with kid” as a task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anything that can’t be translated into an action, you would cross it off your list. It’s like a physical action that tells your brain, &lt;em&gt;this worry doesn’t have a next action, and therefore it’s not worth your mind-space&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the physical act of crossing out or deleting the worry/anxiety/emotion, you can free yourself from it. And now you’ve got a task list to do, which will alleviate the rest of the worries and anxieties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s harder in practice to just strike something off a list and move on. But do it enough times, and it can be a valuable superpower.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Difference Between A Habit And A Task</title>

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a helpful distinction. When is something a task, and when is it a practicing a habit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to understand is &lt;em&gt;every small action we take is a task&lt;/em&gt;. From brushing our teeth, to taking out the trash, to writing a thesis… all are either a task or composed of tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking out the trash might decompose into one task (take it out). Writing a thesis might be composed of 438 tasks (write an outline, draft first paragraph…etc)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A habit is an enhanced task. It comes with intentionality. It is the result of someone seeking change in the world or in their world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A task that is a habit might be small, especially if one is trying to implement or install a new habit. It might be doing one minute of meditation or working on your novel for 30 mins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A regular task is best managed through a to-do system, like a check list or an app like Todoist or a OmniFocus. Do the quantifiable thing, check the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a habit is best managed by a system like Jerry Seinfeld’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.writersstore.com/dont-break-the-chain-jerry-seinfeld/&#34;&gt;don’t break the chain system&lt;/a&gt;. In this system, Jerry writes a new joke every day and marks off the day on his calendar. After that, it’s a matter of not breaking the chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do break the chain? If you miss a day? Start a new chain and move on like nothing happened. This is different than a run of the mill task because I don’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to practice jazz guitar every day. I don’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to read. My life will continue without these habits. But if I don’t turn in that report or schedule that meeting, I might lose my job or my customer’s trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick way to remember: habits are things you want to do, things you want to integrate into your life as second nature; tasks are things you have to remember to do. Roughly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Can You Pull It Off</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a clothing store in Wyoming in 1999, I was confronted by clothing for the first on my own. My mom had purchased almost every piece of clothing that I owned, and now, on my first cross country trip by myself, I was in a clothing store and able to try out whatever I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were all sorts of clothes. Cool looking button downs, khakis, hats, everything. It was kind of liberating, at the age of 14, to be able to go through a clothing rack and for the first time, decide what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; wanted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I could go totally wild, I realized. I could pick something completely outlandish, something that I never would’ve been given to wear in middle school. I pulled out a see-through mesh black shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you think it’s a nice shirt?” I asked a young clerk at the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Um,” she said, looking over my super skinny 14-year old body, “as long as you think you can pull It off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put the shirt back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to &lt;em&gt;pull something off?&lt;/em&gt; In this instance, I think what the clerk was trying to tell me was that if you’re going to wear a see through shirt, you should probably have the body to be able to justify that decision. Fair enough. In that context, it definitely wasn’t the right shirt for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I wonder how many of us feel like it we can’t pull something off, so we don’t do or wear or live that thing. How much of pulling it off is quieting the inner critic? Did Miles Davis think he could pull off all of his wild and eclectic jazz albums? Did JK Rowling think she could pull off Harry Potter, despite being rejected by tons of publishers before finally finding success?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulling it off is just a matter of conviction then. I could’ve pulled off that shirt with the right attitude, who knows. Sure, it would’ve been a different pattern than most people are used to (skinny guy wearing a shirt that is usually worn by someone muscular), but perhaps I could’ve &lt;em&gt;pulled that off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulling something off is not hard. Believing in yourself? That part is &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I noticed that my car’s dashboard calendar was off I tried to adjust it. It was off by a year in the past. When I tried to adjust it, I found it only went up to 2018 – pressing the forward button one more time set me back to 1999. The manufacturer had not considered a world in which this car would still be in use after 2018.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;To be stuck in the past is a serious situation. I’d feel the same way if the car was stuck on a future date too. If you’re living in the past, it’s hard to enjoy the fullness of the present moment. Impossible, even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are millions of people who are so scared of the future that they willingly &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; to live in the past. I’ve experienced this. Call it depression, call it anxiety, call time resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driving around in this broken system, maybe I’ll start to forget what year it really is. Maybe I’ll show up for parties that have already happened. Maybe I’ll forget recent events and be stuck in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a dangerous place to be, the past. The future is no better. But both are static. Like a diving board above a raging sea, and no urgency to jump. You can stare at the violent waters as long as you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present moment though gives us a thrilling chance to surf.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you take it plain, no ice, in a tall glass? Or in a metal water bottle? Glass? BPA-free plastic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s ice, do you take it crushed or cubed? Is there any fruit infused? Do you like carbonation in your water?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you drink it alone, or with your meal? My grandmother used to claim that drinking water while eating softens the food and makes it hard to digest. I haven’t verified this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps you like it from a fountain. Or through an IV. With a straw (metal, paper, or plastic?) or from the lip of a glass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it tap, distilled, mineral infused, electrolyte-enhanced? Did it come from a stream or from a cloud?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What story is the bottle telling you? Is there a wide mouth or a narrow mouth? Does it cap? Is it portable? Does it make a &lt;em&gt;statement&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is your water warm, boiling hot, or salty? Is it infused with cacao beans, or plant leaves and stems?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many ways are there to take something as simple as water and turn it into an experience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this not the best example of what it means to participate in culture?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most important books I’ve read in the last few years has been a book called Stopping the Noise in Your Head by Reid Wilson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is aimed at people who have OCD, but is useful even if you have run of the mill anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the strategies that Wilson talks about in the book is the idea of talking to your anxiety. You can do this by challenging it (“&lt;em&gt;hey anxiety, make my palms sweatier, go on, I dare you!&lt;/em&gt;”). Or even talking down to it (“&lt;em&gt;is that the best you can do, anxiety?!”&lt;/em&gt;), or asking it politely to leave (“&lt;em&gt;thanks for coming by anxiety, but I’m good”&lt;/em&gt;. )&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Or even talking down to it (“&lt;em&gt;is that the best you can do, anxiety?!”&lt;/em&gt;), or asking it politely to leave (“&lt;em&gt;thanks for coming by anxiety, but I’m good”&lt;/em&gt;. )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter what way you talk to it. The trick is that by talking to your anxiety, you are consciously admitting that your anxiety &lt;em&gt;is not you&lt;/em&gt;. This puts a space between you and your anxiety, it moves you up one level of abstraction. It’s the basis for most meditation techniques and cognitive behavioral therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing how this small action can unglue the anxiety stuck to our backs. It doesn’t matter how weighty your anxiety is. Once you identify it as a thing outside of who you are, it loses its steam.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Magic Of Magic Eye</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my eighth birthday, I opted to have a smaller birthday party, which meant about 3 people. I specifically remember what each person at my party game me for my birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One boy had given me a video game, one that I played for years and years, called Dr. Robotnik’s Mean Bean Machine. Another child had given me my first box of Hot Tamales, and I was addicted from then on. The third gift I got was a book called Magic Eye.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;For my eighth birthday, I opted to have a smaller birthday party, which meant about 3 people. I specifically remember what each person at my party game me for my birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One boy had given me a video game, one that I played for years and years, called Dr. Robotnik’s Mean Bean Machine. Another child had given me my first box of Hot Tamales, and I was addicted from then on. The third gift I got was a book called Magic Eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the book were a series of boring looking paintings made of bizarre patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a trick to it,” my friend told me. “If you stare at the pictures long enough, you’ll start to see hidden 3-D images.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I saw in my living room and tried to see the 3D images. At times, I thought maybe I had seen something, but usually the image was fleeting. I tried everything to make it happen – I brought the book close to my face at the suggestion of my friend, and also pulled it far away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched my friend do it, make the 3D images appear… but it didn’t help, because it was happening in &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; vision, not mine. It was hard for him to explain how to do magic eye… he said, it’s just something you &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stared and scrunched and scrutinized and analyzed… but I couldn’t get it. No matter what strategy I used, I always ended up feeling eye-strained and hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until one afternoon, when I had almost given up hope. I reluctantly pulled the book out one more time and looked at the images. I figured that this would have to be my last attempt before I just put the book away forever. At this point, I didn’t even care whether or not I’d see the hidden 3D images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at one of the images, of fish in an aquarium, but this time I did it casually. Like I didn’t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at that very moment, dozens of fish came off the page, floating in front of the book. A hidden 3D image. I finally &lt;em&gt;got it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting a Magic Eye is a weird skill that is hard to describe to someone who has never experienced it. It’s a very distinct relaxing of the eye that we normally don’t perform, at least consciously. It reminds me about all of the other concepts and ways of seeing that seem &lt;em&gt;so obvious&lt;/em&gt; to one person, and so out of reach for another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Magic Eye reminds me that with some puzzles, the harder we try to break through, the less successful we end up being. Like a Chinese Finger Trap, or a box puzzle, the solution is often much simpler than we think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, I learned about the duality of desire: the moment I didn’t care about winning anymore, I won.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Its Okay To Cry</title>

&lt;p&gt;When I found out I was going to have a son, a bunch of anxiety washed over me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was excited, of course, to have a child no matter the gender. But I carried a lot of baggage from my childhood (and beyond) of shaping my relationship with masculinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my key qualities as a child was that I would cry a lot. I was “sensitive” as most of my friends and family called me, and still am to this day (though I’ve made strides in learning to use it in a way that doesn’t derail me or the people around me). And what I got from most of the people in my life was, “stop crying. You’re being too sensitive.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And what I got from most of the people in my life was, “stop crying. You’re being too sensitive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew that one of the most important lessons I would need to teach my son is that crying is okay. Too often as a teacher, I dealt with boys whose parents had somehow convinced them that crying was a bad thing and that they should stop. In fact, crying is an emotional response. It’s a way of processing. And if boys, or anyone else, are taught to restrain themselves from processing emotions, then we’ll end up with a lot of toxic men in our culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that lesson will have to wait. Because right now, he’s &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; at crying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He doesn’t understand words yet, at least not in an instructive way. And he spends a good portion of his waking life crying. He cries if he’s too hot or too cold. He cries if his diaper is too tight. He cries because he’s crying sometimes. Sometimes he laughs and cries at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, no one shames him. No one tells him to stop. Because they understand that it’s part of being a baby, and that babies cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adults cry too. Every single adult I’ve ever known cries. Because, again, they are process strong emotions, and as adults we’ve learned to handle big emotions more efficiently. Children, all of them, are still developing this skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with telling young boys that they shouldn’t cry is that we are forcing them to teach themselves how to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ziahassan.com/daily/how-to-be-sad/&#34;&gt;skip over the sadness and go directly to anger&lt;/a&gt;, since that’s about the only way I can think of to avoid crying and processing sadness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world could use less angry men. The world could benefit from more men who can process emotions gracefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don’t yet have to tell my infant son that it’s okay to cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He already knows.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Low Quality Literature</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-07-17-low-quality-literature/</link>

&lt;p&gt;We have an abundance of low quality literature in our culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It used to be that when you wanted to read something interesting, informative, or aligned with your hobbies, you’d seek it out. You’d head to the library or the book store. Perhaps a friend would lend you a copy of their most life-changing book. The term “high quality” is subjective of course – my mother used to read nothing but Harlequinn romance novels at breakfast when I was a kid, but it made her happy, and that it’s important.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The term “high quality” is subjective of course – my mother used to read nothing but Harlequinn romance novels at breakfast when I was a kid, but it made her happy, and that it’s important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, it’s not the grammar or how well the sentences are constructed, though for some this is a requirement when it comes to high quality literature. It’s about how the writing affects your soul. Perhaps the writing validates your beliefs. That always feels good. But perhaps it challenges your beliefs in such a way that you start to explore the ways in which your opinions might grow. Also good. This could apply to fiction or non-fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most of what we read today is constructed by our friends, or even worse, re-shared by our friends but written by someone else, someone who we’ve never met and can’t engage with on any meaningful level. This is what I mean by low quality. If I agree with what my social media friends have to say, I feel validated, which feels good, but now there’s an element of social interaction to it. I can re-post, or at least feel like I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; re-post. If I disagree with something, I might feel angry, and the anger might leave a residue that sticks around for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, with high quality literature, the point isn’t to grab my eyeballs or clicks; it’s to open my mind. You know how you can tell the difference between literature that opens your mind compared to literature that just provides a knee-jerk reaction? After you read it, you keep it to yourself for a while. Or maybe you share it with your partner. But you know, inherently, that these are ideas meant for digestion before regurgitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out there on the web? It’s nothing but barely digested Cheetos being spat onto the sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I made a pie chart of the amount of text I consumed and then color coded it by “high quality and low quality” it would very likely be something like 90% low quality and 10% high quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still, I’m interested in what my friends have to say. Perhaps not all of them. I don’t exactly know what to do about this, but I do know it’s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Habits Die Very Hard</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the book The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg, the author claims that habits can never be &lt;em&gt;broken&lt;/em&gt; but they can be &lt;em&gt;changed&lt;/em&gt;. This struck me as odd, because of course you can break a habit. I’ve done it many times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as it turns out, any time I’ve broken a habit, I’ve actually just replaced a behavior with another one, whether that was due to a change in environment or in my financial abilities, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Quitting a habit can’t be done. Habit modification comes close enough to be functional, but quitting implies that I could just overcome the habit. And I’ve never done that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went on a social media detox a few months ago, I used an app called Freedom to block all distracting sites, 24 hours a day. The scary part was that even though I knew I couldn’t access these sites, my brain would still try to do it. I’d type in facebook.com into my browser multiple times a day, even though doing so would result in a green block screen. This kept happening throughout the month. You’d think that I would just be able to train my brain to avoid going there, but it turns out that the habit is too strong and too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard it said that neurons that wire together fire together. Thus, developing so-called willpower is pointless. What we need to do is learn how to re-wire our neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Friday Night At The Video Store</title>

&lt;p&gt;Rituals are so important. For some, Friday nights are reserved for pizza night with their family. For me, it was Blockbuster video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockbuster video represented a particular sensory experience – the feet walking around on the carpet, dampening the sound of the footsteps. The smell of the plastic video cases. The walls full of the latest releases. The cardboard posters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most importantly, walking through the aisles gave us a little journey. We’d remember movies that we might have seen in theaters a few months ago, or perhaps videos that had never made it to theaters at all. Random videos, like a TV version of Encyclopedia Brown (a kid’s series) would show up occasionally and totally make my weekend complete. Or perhaps it was a collection of some of the best episodes from Nickelodeon’s Saturday night series, SNICK.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Or perhaps it was a collection of some of the best episodes from Nickelodeon’s Saturday night series, SNICK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then of course there were the aisles of video games, that would give me a weekend to explore a different world than the games I owned. It was always said saying goodbye to the games on Sunday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there was, of course, lots of piracy. The really good videos, we’d record to blank VHS tapes. I still have a ton of those in my basement. Please don’t arrest me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the most valuable parts of the experience wasn’t even the videos or games themselves. It was &lt;em&gt;routine&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;a finite selection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to Blockbuster every Friday was a tradition for the whole family. Mom and Dad would get something, and my sister and I would each pick our own selection. It gave us practice in making choices, in discovering what we liked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it also gave us the joy of having a finite collection. In the world of Netflix, it seems as if you could find a new movie every single day. You could watch part of it and abandon it, whereas with a blockbuster video you had paid a fee per video, so it made sense to see the movie through until the end. There are a lot of movies I would’ve abandoned but stick with just because… well, what else would I watch?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that this routine, this finite collection, the physicality of walking through aisles… is slowly being erased from our culture. I’m not sure what the answer is, since everything is more efficient, but I think about sites like Bandcamp, which come as close as possible to emulating the experience of going to a record store. Because humans, not algorithms, hand pick the selections. It feels more authentic, because it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where do we go from here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was trying to solve some problem with our software and kept coming up empty. As a last resort, I asked her for help and she went back to her desk for a few minutes. When she returned, she’d solved the problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;“How did you do that?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She smiled and said, “I know my tools.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think about this all the time. To me, being a technologist is being a master of tools. It’s knowing which one to use at which time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the way I felt about my endodontist during a recent root canal… he knew what every single instrument did, and was quicker with the tools than most endodontists I had encountered. I felt safe in his office and it because he was a good technologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or another time when a locksmith next door helped my friend with the lock on his back door. He was quick and efficient. I complimented his work, and he shrugged described it as “ape’s work…” but I believe he just knew his tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you feel inadequate, or inefficient, it’s possible that you just have some more to learn about your tools.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What came first? The thinking or the thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we have thoughts? Or do thoughts have us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it’s the latter, then thinking is a kind of cultivation, a gardening of the plants that emerged through a natural process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if, on the other hand, we do produce thoughts the same way we excrete waste or Co2, then we are magical creatures, built with superpowers even we do not understand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;“I think therefore I am” may be true, but could be revised to say that thinking &lt;em&gt;happens&lt;/em&gt; to those that exist, in the same way that growing happens to trees that exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was in my 20’s, when I just moved into an apartment by myself in the woods, I used to stay up pretty late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was something about my apartment, maybe its dark and dingy quality, that made the night seem pretty similar to the day time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d go to bed somewhere between midnight and 2am every night, even if it was a work night. This left me feeling tired and cranky all the time, but since I had lived this way since about the age of 15, I thought it was just normal life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;When I became a teacher, I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to start sleeping earlier. It was a necessity. Then again, the start of my teaching career coincided with turning 28, and a lot of people I know in their early 30’s or late 20’s find themselves going to bed much earlier than they had a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, after I left my teaching job, I kept my sleeping habits – but by that time, my body had settled into the habits and I couldn’t stay awake past 11pm even if I wanted to. I’d end up falling asleep in my chair or on the couch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that sleeping earlier is better for your health than going to bed super late. It’s also been shown that having a consistent bedtime is better than an erratic one. But the biggest benefit I got from going to sleep earlier is that it helped me stop procrastinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in my 20’s, when I used to stay up late, I would delay getting creative projects done. When I got home from work at 6pm, I’d relax and hang out, and I’d figure that I’d working on my creative projects later that night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, then the night would come and I’d be up watching YouTube videos. When I started sleeping earlier, I was &lt;em&gt;forced&lt;/em&gt; to think about my day with more intention. And my time further became constricted when I had a child, so I was forced to &lt;em&gt;stick to a schedule.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two practices have completely transformed my daily life. When I go to bed, I can put a nice bow on the day. It’s over, without question, and I can go to sleep without a million nagging thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A copy of Mario Brothers, in its original sealed packaging recently sold for $100,000. This is apparently pretty rare, more rare than finding a copy of the game that has been lightly used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of value fascinates me. What value do people find in buying the original packaging of a game that can be emulated easily for free by a web browser?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;We are willing to pay to feel a piece of the past. It’s the same thing I pay for when I visit a theme park these days. I’m not thrilled by the rides or the overpriced sodas – it’s the feeling of being in the park that gets me, the way it reminds me of the past. Some would call that nostalgia, but people have created negative associations with the word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s what every collector knows: time is slipping through our hands at an alarming rate. Is it worth it to pay for the chance to hold on just a moment longer?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Serotonin And Dopamine</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Robert Lustig recently wrote a book about two chemicals in the brain: dopamine and serotonin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dopamine, he says, is secreted when we seek short term pleasure. That is, anything that can become addictive. Sweet foods, alcohol, sex, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serotonin on the other hand is secreted when we connect to other humans, when we cook, when we contribute to society, and when we cope (through sleep and exercise).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is pleasure, and serotonin is happiness. Most of us tend to seek out dopamine spikes, and according to Lustig, seeking pleasure actually &lt;em&gt;decreases&lt;/em&gt; Serotonin and therefore happiness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;That’s the part that I find remarkable. By actually riding a short term high, we’re killing our long term sense of serenity. We’re wandering the world searching high and low for the penny we lost — the one that is, unbeknownst to us, still sitting in the folds of our pockets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, in the midst of quite a thunderstorm, I was parked near a auto repair shop. Through my windshield, which was streaked with rain, I noticed a sign that simply said: &lt;em&gt;stay in control.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I immediately felt more grounded after reading it. I do teeter off sometimes, losing my control and poise, and as soon as I had read these very authoritative (nearly commanding) words, my mind snapped back to center. I felt victorious.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I immediately felt more grounded after reading it. I do teeter off sometimes, losing my control and poise, and as soon as I had read these very authoritative (nearly commanding) words, my mind snapped back to center. I felt victorious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that experience was not the essence of the message of this sign. What I had done was regained control, and almost anyone can do that under the right circumstances. Though it isn’t exactly intuitive, many people have props or tools that bring them back into the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snapping a rubber band, hitting a gong, striking a singing bowl, strumming a guitar… all of these are rituals that, if we lose our way, can bring us back to the path (whatever that means for us individually).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can &lt;em&gt;reclaim&lt;/em&gt; control. But to &lt;em&gt;stay&lt;/em&gt; in control? To not let the mind wander or the attention slip? That might be an act of God. At the very least, it’s an impossibility for many folks. Even those who have reached enlightenment won’t &lt;em&gt;stay&lt;/em&gt; in control – they’ll just &lt;em&gt;reclaim&lt;/em&gt; control more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I assume the writer of this sign didn’t actually mean to instruct us to &lt;em&gt;stay&lt;/em&gt; in control. &lt;em&gt;Staying in&lt;/em&gt; makes it sound like a river. You just stay in and you end up where you’re going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But control doesn’t work like this. It is a bit more like like making the bed, or setting the table, or opening your eyes after nodding off. The momentary lapse in attention is reclaimed often enough that control seems to flow. But that’s just an illusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can’t ever &lt;em&gt;stay&lt;/em&gt; in control. The best we can do is avoid wandering too far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the hardest parts of therapy for me is when my therapist asks me to listen to my inner desires. It seems easy enough, and for most of my life, it seems that my inner desires have been pretty obvious and overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then again, I tend to seek out advice quite a bit for problems that only I could ever possibly have the answer to. Questions like, what job should I take? How should I handle this ambiguous situation? What car should I buy?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;While advice from others isn’t unhelpful, sometimes I feel that I rely on external validation far too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because if I’m able to listen to my inner voice, I can make decisions fairly easily. All of the people I ask for advice might say one thing, and my inner voice might say the complete opposite. So what do you do in that case? This is really tricky territory. On one hand, your voice maters, but on the other, can you trust it enough that you will shut out every external voice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve only recently learned to trust my inner voice enough to make certain decisions with it, but many people still don’t have a level of trust with their inner voice that they’re comfortable with. They’re the ones that will analyze and re-analyze every decision to the point of breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you trust your inner voice too much (as in, you never listen to anyone else), it’s possible that you’ll make regretful decisions. The voice is, after all, a part of you, but it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s best to maintain a healthy balance of skepticism and optimism when it comes to the inner voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those quick and somewhat irrelevant decisions, such as whether to get salad or fries, we have our habit systems. Those might be optimal or they may be leading us down a dangerous path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for everything else, there’s the inner voice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Argument Against Juicing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting documentaries I’ve watched in the past decade is called Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead. In it, the filmmakers make the case for juicing, claiming that since juice contains all of the nutrients in the actual fruit or vegetable, so drinking juice will put those nutrients directly into our bloodstream, much more quickly than it would if we were to spend time digesting a vegetable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you start to pick through the research, you come across an interesting fact: many of the benefits of eating a plant come from eating it whole, due to the fiber and extra nutrients that are discarded when you juice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Many of the compounds in these vegetables are ones that we haven’t identified yet or don’t fully understand. We know they’re beneficial to our bodies, but we’re not &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; sure why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same could be said for apps like Blinkist, that give you the adult cliff’s notes of business books. Sure, someone could extract all the meaning out of a book and give it to you in a few sentences, but that doesn’t actually stack up to the benefit of reading an entire book. When you get the author’s every word, it might be occasionally repetitive, but the learnings will stick with you much more deeply than if you just read a summary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m anti-juicing, unless I can get the same benefit for less effort. Seems that is rarely the case.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cheating Vs Relaxing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a concept in the dieting world called a “cheat day,” where the dieter will stick to a strict diet most of the time, but will take one day to indulge in the things they like, the things that they were trying to give up by dieting in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could also apply for non-dieting situations, in which the hopeful habit changer is trying to restrict their use of some other kind of drug. A “cheat day” would essentially be a relapse day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;There’s a concept in the dieting world called a “cheat day,” where the dieter will stick to a strict diet most of the time, but will take one day to indulge in the things they like, the things that they were trying to give up by dieting in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could also apply for non-dieting situations, in which the hopeful habit changer is trying to restrict their use of some other kind of drug. A “cheat day” would essentially be a relapse day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name of this concept, the “cheat day,” is a misnomer. Actual cheating happens when you take advantage of a feature of a system, when you achieve an outcome for which the system did not intend. But our diet “cheat day” is an &lt;em&gt;integral&lt;/em&gt; part of the dieting system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we build in a cheat day, anyway? We do it because we know, deep down, that 100% restriction will never work, and that we will relapse at some point if we try to do that. Either life experience or just common sense teaches us this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in that case, the “cheat day” play an important role. It allows us to stay connected to our vices, but only just so. We &lt;em&gt;flirt&lt;/em&gt; with a relapse but never quite pull the trigger. The strategy works for some, and it doesn’t for some others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s not quite cheating. There’s a strange dichotomy with eating healthily: unless you absolutely love to eat healthy foods, you are constantly fighting a battle between doing what you know is right and indulging in the joys of life (like sugar).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we could call it a &lt;em&gt;relax day&lt;/em&gt; instead, where we put our guard down and let whatever happens happen. And perhaps the &lt;em&gt;relax&lt;/em&gt; day could extend into the way we act during that day. Instead of being mad at ourselves for indulging, we can build “relax” into the system so that we can live life in a more balanced way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Intention Convenience Curve</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The art of catching a show on TV is dead. The only time where I actually watch live TV anymore is at a hotel, or perhaps on an airplane which doesn’t really count as live TV anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a time where I would dart back from my 5:30 block class at university just to catch the latest episode of Prison Break. And today, all of Stranger Things 3 is available on Netflix &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But there’s something to be said for catching a show, because of something that I’d like to call the intention-convenience curve. As the amount of intention goes up, convenience goes down. It’s easy to get accidentally sucked into a TV show on Netflix that’s featured on their main page. It’s convenient but very non-intentional. And then there are shows like 24, which needed to be watched at a particular time each week to stay up to date. You had to be a true fan in order to make that work. It wasn’t convenient to get to your TV or remember to record the show, but it sure was intentional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to be clear, where a show falls on this curve says nothing about its quality. But it does say something about the way in which we consume media in 2019. Most of what we watch falls in the non-intentional but highly convenient category, which perhaps means that we watch more than we need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10-15 years ago, you could often find a lot of people that didn’t watch the same shows as you. It’s much easier now because our ability to binge mindlessly has skyrocketed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes me wonder where we’ll be in 15-20 years from now. Will we move back on the curve, or continue into the great unknown?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many new parents complain that they lose themselves a bit after their child arrives. It’s hard to stay on top of anything related to creativity, fitness, and nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been a guy who does a million projects at once. So I devised a plan when my son was born. I would touch each one of my projects every day, so that I would remain connected to it. The thinking was that if I don’t do this, I’ll be distracted by not finishing my work (this is a real thing for artists). And if I manage to touch them all, I will be in the present moment when I’m with him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And if I manage to touch them all, I will be in the present moment when I’m with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it worked, kind of. Every day I spent 5-10 mins on each project (a book, an album, an app, this blog, and learning how to play jazz guitar). And even if I just played one chord or wrote one lyric, I would count it as fulfilling the habit each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when I was with my son, I was totally focused on him. It was kind of a relief. I wished I had done the habit tracking trick sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The projects on the other hand, were slow as hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In trying to do a lot of things at one time, and spending only a few minutes on each project, I had a habit and a routine, but I didn’t have enough space to really move the needle. Mostly I’d start something small and then would switch to something else, not really getting to digest or dig in to any sort of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It felt nice to get things done, but it was far from fulfilling. And so I scaled back to creative habits to just one – writing the book. And a few months later, as in now, I’ve finished the first draft of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole experience made me realize that I find more fulfillment in finishing just one thing than I do in staying engaged with many multiple projects at once. Pushing something new into the world is a thrill, and all the work that leads up to it is fulfilling, but only if I’m meaningfully engaged and not just checking an item off of a list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I stayed up all night it was New Years Eve, and I was eleven. I just wanted to see what would happen. It was the end of the rainbow. I was curious what would happen I stayed up all night. So hour by hour, I eventually got to the end. The sun rose and I hadn’t missed anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of the rainbow is also useful when trying to lose weight. You eat a salad for lunch one day and think to yourself, &lt;em&gt;ah, that wasn’t so hard. What if I do that every day?&lt;/em&gt; So you eat it the next day and the day after that. And then one day your pants are three sizes smaller and everyone in the office is giving you compliments. End of the rainbow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It’s a great way to advance in your career, too. What would happen if you really gave this routine sales presentation my all? And the next day? And the next? Until one day you’re the CEO. End of the rainbow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realizing a dream isn’t something that happens randomly one day. You make it happen by walking until we get to the bitter end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helpful performance reviews, the ones that have just the right balance of praise and actionable feedback, are difficult to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some jobs, like teaching, the standards for success are so ridiculous that it’s easy to feel inadequate and defensive right from the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when I was a Resident Assistant in college, I had one of the best bosses I’ll ever have. Clear, communicative, understanding, and firm. A few days before my year end evaluation meeting, she sent me the rubric that she would be using to evaluate me, and asked me to fill it out for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did it, and I was honest in my responses. For a few areas, I felt I had met the mark, and for a few others I felt that I was over or under by a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I arrived to her office for the evaluation, she said: “I’m going to show you what I thought you deserved on the performance rubrics. But, if we did this right, your self-assessment should align with mine. &lt;em&gt;Nothing should come as a surprise.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She went on to explain that if she had achieved her goal of keeping a clear and open communication channel with me, and frequently checking in, that there was no way I would be surprised at the results of my assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And she was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another college class I took, we were forced to grade each other’s papers using a very specific rubric. What we realized by the time we were done ripping each other’s papers to shreds is that our own papers were total crap too. The second and third drafts of the papers were a million times better, and we understood the revision and evaluation process much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I later achieved straight A’s in grad school by doing this – sticking to what the rubric deemed successful. And I was never surprised by grade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that when clear expectations are laid out, and people are held accountable, no assessment results will ever come as a surprise. And when everyone’s on the same page about their strengths and challenges, growth is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Opposite Of Mindfulness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In meditation, we sit in pure observation of our thoughts. We purposefully go out of our minds for a brief and beautiful few moments. We see it all, the pain, the joy, and the wonder, from the outside, mostly to remind ourselves that there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we can almost sustain it. After spending two minutes in Zazen this morning, I left feeling energized and positive, ready for a day of doing my job and not even caring that it’s a weekend because I love what I do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;And we can almost sustain it. After spending two minutes in Zazen this morning, I left feeling energized and positive, ready for a day of doing my job and not even caring that it’s a weekend because I love what I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I even recall hitting some walls during the day, and while it took me a second or two, I was able to go out of my mind long enough to observe my emotions and acknowledge that they aren’t “me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the entire day in active conversation with engaged educators and felt intellectually and physically stimulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I returned to my hotel room, I crashed on my bed in order to relax. I pulled out my phone and started checking out my social media feeds. After 5-10 mins, I was back in my own head, telling myself stories about people, filling in the gaps, and making myself feel emotions from semi-fictional narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the opposite of mindfulness. It’s not life. Life is mostly normal until there are bumps, and almost anyone can deal with a few bumps everyday. A bump takes us back into our mind, but if we are mentally fit, we can go out and back in again, which cleanses us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But surfing our feeds? It’s more like a road littered with potholes. We don’t just get into our heads but we bury ourselves there. We forget sometimes where reality lives. We wallow and we let our mind scribble markers all over the walls of our psyche. We sit back and sigh, assuming we can’t really do much about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would pay a lot of money to have a social media service that had no ads, and no random comments from people I don’t know. I wouldn’t seen tweets from strangers that were “liked” by my friends. I wouldn’t get wrapped into random convos on a news feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the power to avoid all of this of course. But it’s hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are you supposed to say to your mind when it is flailing around in a kiddie pool thinking it’s drowning in the ocean?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Skipping A Habit</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every now and then it becomes necessary to skip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve installed a new habit recently, like within the last month, you &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; skip. Or else you’ll put your habit formation in danger. It’s not that skipping will definitely derail you, but it could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A habit, in its infancy, is a house of cards. The wind could blow it down and you’d have to start all over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when a habit is solidified, you’ll know. You’ll know because you won’t need to remember to do the habit, it’ll happen almost autonomously thanks to a part of your brain called the basal ganglia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Writing this blog every day has become a habit for me. I don’t queue up posts or anything. But yesterday, I had to skip. I’m leaving for a trip today and was a single parent while my wife was on a business trip of her own. The blog post will happen over the course of my day, normally. It’ll just happen. Yesterday, I just fell asleep before it happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing about good habits like daily writing is once you’ve really established it (I’ve been at this for about a year), you can skip a day and pick up the next day like nothing happened. And for habits you decide are bad, the same is true. It makes you realize how similar bad and good habits are. We just assign them a sentiment, but ultimately all they are is neurons firing together automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lasting change is hard. Don’t skip when you’re forming a habit. But don’t beat yourself up if you’ve established a permanent habit and skipped a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brain is more resilient than you think.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Practicing Hunger</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-06-19-practicing-hunger/</link>

&lt;p&gt;When I used to travel to Indianapolis every Monday, I would take an early morning flight and not eating anything until about 1 or 2pm. It didn’t seem to ever phase me very much, though I was pretty hungry around lunchtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out my habit of skipping breakfast is technically classified as intermittent fasting, since I had been without food for 14-16 hours. And while the term wasn’t popular at the time (most of the conventional wisdom claimed breakfast was &lt;em&gt;the most important&lt;/em&gt; meal of the day), I was unknowingly benefitting from the process of autophagy, which is when your cells start to repair themselves after a certain number of hours without any food.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I started intermittently fasting again intentionally when I wanted to lose weight. I can’t say that not eating breakfast specifically helped me to lose weight, but it certainly made the number of calories I eat in a day decrease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what I really learned didn’t have to do with any of this. It has to do with hunger. We often think of skipping a meal as restricting ourselves, and that restriction is bad by default. But to be honest, if I could just eat whenever and whatever I wanted, I’d never stop snacking (and never did, when I had my old eating habits a couple of years ago).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restriction can be good. It can be healing, if we have addictions. It certainly isn’t the only or best solution for everyone or everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But intermittent fasting also taught me that hunger, like almost all things, comes in waves. Instead of deprivation, I think of it as “practicing hunger.” Almost every major religion has some kind of fasting built in as a way of cleansing our spirits. Being uncomfortable, and reminding ourselves that we can survive discomfort is invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And hunger doesn’t get worse and worse. It gets intense, and then normal again, intense, and then normal again. And while I’d never do something like deprive myself of food for an entire day (though there are people that do it, look up OMAD), practicing hunger makes me remember that our bodies and minds are more resilient than we think.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The other night, I had the pleasure of seeing one of my best friends on stage on at the Kennedy Center. The show he was in was a really interesting piece, full of wonder and introspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During some of the more abstract moments, I found myself becoming aware, like I would in sitting meditation. All senses just scanning the dark room, directing my attention to each one: the faint stream of air from the conditioner, the stage lights creating a mist in the air…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;And then I started tuning in to the sounds of the theater. Not just the music on stage but what was being “played” all around me. In a John Cage way, I started hearing the audience themselves. Rustling in their purses, chewing on a piece of gum, coughing, sighing, squeaking as they shifted in their chairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Has all this noise been here the whole time?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had, and my brain was filtering it out like sand through a comb. It’d be hard to enjoy a show in that state, so I quickly redirected my attention to the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in that moment, I noticed how easily awareness can come. I flipped a switch, and there it was, in a crowded theater audience, who were intently wrapped in a musical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of entry points to awareness never fail to amaze me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He points at me, and then one by one at all of the other important things in the room. He makes little noises each time he points, which sound aesthetically like “What’s that? And that? And that?”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;We have names and functions for these things, I tell him. The clock gives us an illusion of certainty, the paintings are windows to other worlds, the closet contains a spectrum of presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then he will point again at the same object. And that’s when I realize he’s not asking me, he’s showing me. It’s as if he’s saying “Look! It’s beautiful! I’ve never seen anything like it!” and I am answering by naming something that is, to him, eternally nameless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so he teaches me: pointing at objects is &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt;. The whole thing. The… well, the “point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiosity by way of observation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stillness On A Rollercoaster</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Try this: bring back a memory of yourself on a roller coaster or theme park ride. Whenever I do this, my memory doesn’t play back like memories of other events. That is to say, when I think of my high school graduation, it plays back like clips from a movie. Sometimes in these memories, I am not the point of view, I’m the observer. Maybe I’m actually having s memory of watching the &lt;em&gt;video&lt;/em&gt; of graduation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Maybe I’m actually having s memory of watching the &lt;em&gt;video&lt;/em&gt; of graduation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I think of a roller coaster memory, it’s different. There’s no real motion in my mind movie. It’s a still frame. I’m upside down on a steel coaster, the sun invading my corneas from a cloudless sky. And it’s quiet inside of this moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or I’m next to my cousin who’s mad at me for whatever reason. I see her angry face right as we hit the bottom of a drop. There is a stillness in the midst of this dance between potential and kinetic energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can it be that such a chaotic memory is recalled as a moment of stillness? Perhaps when we ride a roller coaster, we lose ourselves. It’s nearly impossible to be in our own head, and we are definitely not thinking about what’s for dinner. We are observing our sensations, like the Buddha. We have no other choice. Our lives are gently at risk, and yet we feel safe. There’s no comparable experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now in my 30s, roller coasters give me headaches. But I will forever be in search of experiences that gently meld together feelings of safety, exhilaration, and stillness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a teacher, my summer breaks were somewhat structured. I had a routine. Every day, I’d wake up and go for a walk around downtown Silver Spring, which is where I lived at the time. I’d visit the library and get myself a pastry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, around mid-July or so, right in the dead of summer break, I’d watch all of the Ocean’s movies, and both Kill Bills. Occasionally there was an Inception thrown in there somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;People have comfort movies. For some, it’s during Christmas when Home Alone is on TV on a loop. Or, perhaps they’ll catch one of their favorite films on a channel late at night (if you even have TV channels anymore). For me it often happens at a hotel. Or Harry Potter in the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have my share of comfort movies too, but a &lt;em&gt;yearly&lt;/em&gt; movie, like the ones I watched over my summer break, almost feels like a birthday party due to the annual nature of the exercise. It became less about the movies themselves, but about revisiting a familiar world. Weirdly, in order to feel more grounded in the real world, I had to spend a few moments in an imaginary one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But comfort is fleeting. A bag of Doritos is comforting, but it’s not nourishing. Re-watches that spur growth are much more rare but better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, Six Feet Under falls into this category. I end up relating a different character and plot line each time I watch it. It turns out that Six Feet Under is so well written, with characters that are so expansive, that I can relate to different ones in different ways each time I watch it at different points in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what makes a re-watch useful: it adds something new every time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kids Arent Good At Tech</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Educators and parents have made an assumption about technology that is hurting children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thinking goes like this: children naturally understand how to use technology. We don’t even need to teach them anymore. In fact, we should be letting them teach us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we buy into this, we’re making a grave error. It turns out that kids &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; inherently good at technology. Just like when we were kids, technology is a skill that must be learned and practiced.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Educators and parents have made an assumption about technology that is hurting children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thinking goes like this: children naturally understand how to use technology. We don’t even need to teach them anymore. In fact, we should be letting them teach us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we buy into this, we’re making a grave error. It turns out that kids &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt; inherently good at technology. Just like when we were kids, technology is a skill that must be learned and practiced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just so happens that some of our newer technology, like iPads, are intuitive enough that students can teach themselves how to use them more quickly than they would have with a Desktop machine in the 90’s. It also helps that a touchscreen is more engaging and visual than a typical keyboard/monitor setup. Uniformity in app design also helps us learn new apps more quickly. You don’t need to re-learn how to use an interface with every new app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so if you give a child an iPad and an app they’ve never seen before, there’s a good chance they’ll figure out how to use it quickly. Perhaps more quickly than we might. And so we think that this is some sort of trait inherent to digital natives. And perhaps swiping and tapping skills are taught to today’s kids early, which helps strengthen their technology skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But give them a problem to solve with technology, and they’ll ask “where’s the app?” If there’s no app to solve the problem, they’re a standstill. And there are great new apps that automate processes on the iPhone and iPad, like Drafts and Shortcuts. These apps allow the user who doesn’t identify as a programmer to start creating scripts and solutions where there previously weren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, I created a Shortcut that calculates the time it will take me to get home from wherever I am located, and then automatically sends a text to my wife in the background to let her know how long I’ll be. A solution to a problem without a specific app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching kids how to automate might become the gateway to understanding how to talk to technology to solve problems. We shouldn’t be raising the next generation to be swipers and tappers. We should be raising them to be thinkers and solvers and doers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that requires the same old skills we’ve taught and learned since forever.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Two Voices In Your Head</title>

&lt;p&gt;You can try this experiment at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find a nice place to sit, and breathe in and out deeply for a minute. I’ll wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you were breathing, you may have heard your own voice talking to yourself in your head. Perhaps your inner voice was kind of a giggle at how silly you look sitting here breathing. Perhaps the inner voice told you it was bored.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;When you were breathing, you may have heard your own voice talking to yourself in your head. Perhaps your inner voice was kind of a giggle at how silly you look sitting here breathing. Perhaps the inner voice told you it was bored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And despite the fact that this inner voice sounds like you, talks like you, and feels like you… it isn’t you. And I can prove it. We can call the voice a number of things: monkey mind, amygdala, the resistance. But none of things are &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this internal voice is one you’ve dealt with your entire life. It’s the one that convinced you to eat chocolate cake, to give up writing your screenplay, and that you’ll never lose weight. And you can prove to yourself that this voice isn’t you by talking back to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right, talk back to it. When it tells you you’re no good, say “that’s just your opinion.” If it tells you something that sounds like an assumption, challenge it. Get into a little quip but don’t be the one to lose your cool. If you can’t agree, just agree to disagree and walk away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second voice, the one talking back, that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; you. And for most of our lives we conflate the monkey with mind with &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;. But talking back is a great way to separate from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And interestingly, when we talk back, we cultivate a wiser voice, a counter to the monkey mind. Perhaps this voice &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; us, or perhaps it’s just a persona, but either way, it’s the one that disagrees when the monkey mind does its thing. And it becomes wiser the more it challenges, asserts, and disagrees. Who wouldn’t want to cultivate a wise inner voice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more powerful is to stay tight lipped around the monkey mind. To let it stamp, pout, mutter, and eventually fall asleep in its own vomit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s much harder, but worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Appointments With Creativity</title>

&lt;p&gt;In her fantastic book, &lt;em&gt;A Poetry Handbook&lt;/em&gt;, Mary Oliver writes about her methods for writing and also reading poetry. One of the most interesting things she says has to do with creativity, and even though I’ve read so many books on creativity and the creative process, it still stopped me in my tracks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Writing a poem… is a kind of possible love affair between something like the heart and the learned skills of the conscious mind. They make appointments with each other, and keep them, something starts to happen. Or, they make appointments with them but are casual and often forget to keep them; count on it, nothing happens.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Or, they make appointments with them but are casual and often forget to keep them; count on it, nothing happens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Oliver’s work is an exercise in noticing and awareness. These are traits that not all poets have, but the best ones certainly have. And come to think of it, so do most of the best comedians, playwrights, lawyers, activists…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all of the practitioners of any art have to make appointments. For me, that involves an actual app and a separate calendar for my daily events. This calendar can be pretty microscopic, with “events” like &lt;em&gt;practice posture exercises.&lt;/em&gt; I also put in any act of creating (writing, recording, editing) into this app as well. I make an appointment, and it is only by doing this that I accomplish &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; at all (my most recent book is an example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are probably those who just manage to find time in their day, but they probably don’t have kids, or their job is so structured that they can predictably find enough time in their day to pay attention to whatever needs to come out (and in which case, that is a sort of appointment as well). And there are those who act whenever their heart and mind happen to brush up next to each other in the grocery store, but those kinds of artists are far from consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mary Oliver also takes it a step further with the idea of a meeting of the heart and the mind. The heart wants to run free, to teach, to exclaim. The brain wants to use its experience to shape and form the castle. There’s no art without both being involved, and just like with any group project, it makes more sense to figure out who will do what through a group meeting than it does to just open the paint cans and say go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-limitations-of-task-managers&#34;&gt;The Limitations of Task Managers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve written many articles about how to manage tasks, or at least how I manage tasks. There are so many different systems with which one can wrangle their tasks together, though I find David Allen’s Getting Things Done methodology to be the most inclusive and most customizable. If GTD is a technology, then perhaps it has the most “switches” and “settings.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If GTD is a technology, then perhaps it has the most “switches” and “settings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But systems like GTD only set us up to sink the ball into the hole; that is, they provide a framework with which we can sort our tasks and filter our lists down to a manageable and do-able size. GTD (and other systems) also build in a weekly check-in of some sort so that tasks don’t get lost in the shuffle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the thing that GTD doesn’t do is tell us how to execute on the task. All the parameters and thinking goes around how to organize lists so that execution becomes a breeze. But that only does so much to help someone with a wandering attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-short-burst-vs-deep-work&#34;&gt;The Short Burst vs. Deep Work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago, over a decade probably, I discovered the idea of pomodoros, which means working for 25 minutes, taking a 5 minute break, and repeating this over and over until you’ve completed your task for the day. I credit pomodoros for getting me through college, grad school, and many other tasks where my attention wanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t use pomodors anymore, however. I’ve found that there’s a certain flow that can escape me if I’m interrupted after 25 minutes. Sure, I could click the timer back off and continue my work, but even that momentary pause is enough to throw me off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book, Deep Work, Cal Newport seems to be against the idea of the pomodoro, or short burst of work. He recommends 90 minute or more work periods of intense focus. If you can’t do that at the start, you can work up to it. Pomodoros were training me to keep my attention short. So while they were helping me to get work done, they were actually &lt;em&gt;hurting&lt;/em&gt; my ability to focus and stay attentive for long periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;negative-consequences-of-pomodoro-training&#34;&gt;Negative Consequences of Pomodoro Training&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This manifested in a bunch of ways that were not immediately apparent. Movies became harder to watch for example, but I loved watching YouTube videos that were 20 mins or shorter. I used to listen to full albums but now find myself stuck on one song over and over, and exploring generated playlists vs. really getting into an album. Hell, even the &lt;em&gt;types&lt;/em&gt; of music I was listening to changed – I had replaced much of my ambient and jazz music (long pieces) with short, poppy hits. Part of that can be blamed on my decision to use Spotify as my main music consumption vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now, I’m attempting to lengthen my attention such that I don’t need a pomodoro to get my work done. I meditate so that I can practice the art of bringing the mind back when it wanders, and through writing a long-form book (being released soon), I have also cultivated this skill. It’s still a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;awareness-is-key&#34;&gt;Awareness is Key&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re unsure of how to start with changing your focus, the first thing you can is become aware of then you drift. How long does it normally take you? Do you pause every paragraph, or at the end of every sentence, or every 30 seconds…?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have an awareness of where you are, it’s much easier to decide where you need to be. Maybe pomodoros are a good starting point, and they can be really useful with manual tasks like washing the dishes… but for creative tasks, it is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; important to lengthen the working period until you get to 90 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, 25 minutes just isn’t enough to elicit the levels of creativity that I know I’m capable of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If this topic interests you, there’s an entire book on the subject of Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. I also recommend Deep Work by Cal Newport, which gives some specific strategies and reasoning for why one would want to be in a flow state while working on a creative endeavor).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Semantic Satiation How To Taste Mindfulness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Zazen, meditation, mindfulness, yoga… take your pick. Every one of these arts has a component of thought observation: the mind must observe itself. It’s a meta-cognitive struggle that startles you the first time you try it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s the thing – you have to choose to try it. Observing your thoughts is not instinctive. We’re supposed to worry, dwell, and be anxious so that our amygdala can protect this from threats. Only there aren’t that many threats that we need to be protected from. So we end up fearful of &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;, or put another way, fearful of that which does not exist. Observing thoughts lifts you up one level of abstraction, and you consciously stop equating yourself with a thought or emotion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Observing thoughts lifts you up one level of abstraction, and you consciously stop equating yourself with a thought or emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-do-it&#34;&gt;How to do it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you do it? Well, some would say that it’s like observing traffic from a helicopter. Your mind wants to get wrapped up in a thought, but because you’ve decided to be aware, you get out of the thought loop as soon as the thought passes. You don’t grab it back and shake it down for pocket change. If you do this over and over for 5-10 minutes, that is a state of Zazen. If this proves to be challenging, there are some scaffolds, like humming or saying ohm, which is like an anchor that keeps bringing you back to awareness if you find yourself getting wrapped up in a thought. I hesitate to call it a brain hack: it’s not a hack, it’s in the manual no one has read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was talking to a friend of mine, a fellow meditator, and she told me that she’s not sure if she is actually &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; meditation whenever she does it. Afterward, she’s left with this feeling of _I guess that was meditating?_I admitted to her that I get the same feeling after I’m done meditating. So together, we figured that that probably &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the feeling you’re supposed to get after meditation. Because it seems so simple and straightforward, but can yield such cosmic results, it’s easy to assume we’re doing it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;words-become-sound&#34;&gt;Words Become Sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Watts, in one of his lectures, tells the audience to let his voice become more like noise, let the words lose their meaning. Once you start hearing his voice as noise, eventually you can start hearing your own internal voice that way. I’ve never experienced this kind of clarity while meditating, but there is one weird occasion, one specific phenomenon, that I have experienced and it comes very close to this: semantic satiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semantic satiation is the feeling you get when you repeat a word so many times that it loses its meaning. You start to question whether that word is even a word at all, whether it ever had meaning to begin with. You can try this by picking a word (preferably one-syllable) and repeating it over and over out loud. At some point it will sound weird and foreign, like a noise that you kind of recognize but can’t quite place. When you get to this stage, you’re getting a little taste of mindfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because in that higher level of abstraction, you stop adding meaning to everything. You stop the constant narration. Words are just sounds, people are just blobs of flesh, and there is no &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; at all, just a series of brain activity being observed with no end goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting thing about semantic satiation is that the practice requires repetition of a word, rather than avoiding saying the world altogether. It’s almost as if you’re trying to convince yourself that the meaning you’ve associated with this word is fairly transient by saying it over and over, and at some point your brain starts believing you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more we try to hold on to it, the more it slips away.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I found it on Amazon for $50. It was a cool looking one that seems to stick on a wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a little bit for me – I had a stack of CDs from High School that my parents had kept at their house until recently. It felt nice to pull from a CD wallet instead of going on Spotify or some other app and letting its algorithm influence my choice of what to listen to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But it was mostly for my son. Everyone cultivates their own taste in music, and no one ever dismisses music altogether (do they?), therefore I feel that it’s important that he has a finite collection of music to explore instead of a universe of smart tags and metadata rewiring his brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would also allow me to introduce him to bands and artists. He may not enjoy them as much, but at least it’s there if he ever needs it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s more wisdom, more than you realize, that can be found in a 12-track album that had a one-hit wonder. There are songs there that were never meant to be fully played. Where artists could be at their most vulernable, for better or worse. Try listening to the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; tracks on a Bush album, or on a Verve Pipe album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in today’s music industry, people release singles with the same gusto we used to reserve for full albums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And surely my son will find his way to online streaming music one day, probably sooner than I realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to start with music, everyone could use a walled garden to live in for a time. To sit in the grass and learn every piece of dirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what the CD collection offers – a chance to sit down and observe. Not driving, not mindlessly listening on the subway, but actually paying attention. Also, a compact disc also integrated artwork, that is part of the physical disc itself. That physical disc that you put into a player, that you watch spin and melt into a pond of colors. A disc that has actual &lt;em&gt;tracks&lt;/em&gt; where the songs live, that you can see when you look closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We keep searching for the infinite because we don’t realize just how much beauty is in the finite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Take a journey. Long or short, internal or external.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exhale slowly while humming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat a vegetable in slow motion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stretch hamstrings and glutes for longer than 20 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch water boil/flow/drip. A tap or a river, it doesn’t matter.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Some Complaints About Podcasts</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-06-04-some-complaints-about-podcasts/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-06-04-some-complaints-about-podcasts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Podcasts are slowly becoming my favorite medium, and from talking to friends and family, it seems I’m not the only one. I started listening to podcasts back in the dark ages of 2010, before Serial. And I even spent time producing &lt;a href=&#34;mixcloud.com/ziahassan&#34;&gt;my own&lt;/a&gt; back in 2011, interviewing whomever I could, and telling whatever stories I could possibly come up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Serial came out, with its NPR sleekness and vocal fry, and what followed was somewhat of a podcasting revolution. Blogs fell out of fashion, and even videos (which at one point were seen as the &lt;em&gt;new new hotness&lt;/em&gt;) were taking a backseat to podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Then Serial came out, with its NPR sleekness and vocal fry, and what followed was somewhat of a podcasting revolution. Blogs fell out of fashion, and even videos (which at one point were seen as the &lt;em&gt;new new hotness&lt;/em&gt;) were taking a backseat to podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly there were cool new apps to play podcasts, and there were podcasts about extremely nuanced and complex topics. There’s even one on fountain pens, if you can believe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is pretty cool. When you hear someone talking about a subject you’re passionate about weekly, it can sometimes feel like you’ve gained a new, interesting and intellectual friend. It feels a bit like you know them. And the podcasts that are done exceedingly well are as addicting as anything else online, but they feel much more organic and less scripted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with that said, I have some complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audio quality. Since it’s easy to get sound into a computer these days, many people think it’s okay to skimp on a quality system. People don’t worry about acoustics in the room, vocal tone, EQ, or even putting a goddamn pop filter on the microphone (the thing that stops your plosives from being so explosive).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too close to radio. There are some podcasts I’ve listened to that have crazy music playing in the background while the commentator shouts like it’s a monster truck rally. This may have been a good way to conduct business in the days of FM radio, where louder signaled more professional, but we live in a world of iPod earbuds and personal audio experiences. It’s safe to say that some of the best podcasts are the ones that feel like you’re sitting in a room and listening to someone have a conversation. Audience of one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too much like a blog. Since we use feeds to get our latest fix of a podcast, it gets &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; annoying when podcasters post 4-5 episodes at a time (looking at you Dave Ramsey). This was fine when we had Tumblr blogs that we could skim through, but podcasts don’t skim quite as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who aren’t great speakers. It’s a skill that anyone can probably develop, but many podcasters haven’t yet. Just having interesting topics to discuss doesn’t mean that the podcast medium is right for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podcasts are still probably the best medium right now and I fully support anyone wanting to create, well, anything. But I think we need to keep these things in mind as we move forward. It doesn’t cost a lot to get decent audio equipment, to get feedback on your vocal performance, and to be concise with your content.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Compliments File</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-06-03-a-compliments-file/</link>

&lt;p&gt;I keep a journal in an app called Day One. While I don’t think everyone should use this app necessarily, it has a great tagging feature. I tag everything in it from good days to bad days, days where I’ve felt tired, symptoms I’ve had, any interesting changes in my child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, someone sent me an incredible email complimenting my music. Apparently, this person had been listening to my tunes for about a decade and felt the need to write me about how much my music has helped them along their journey. It validated everything I do with my art. Made every single painstaking decision, cut, mix, whatever, all worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It validated everything I do with my art. Made every single painstaking decision, cut, mix, whatever, all worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I took a screenshot of it and stored it in my journal. I tagged it with Compliment. As of now, that compliment file has about 100-150 items in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems a little bit self-centered. Who would create a file all about compliments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the truth is It serves a number of functions. One of them is that it lifts me up on days where I’ll read a negative review of myself. It doesn’t make me forget about the negative words, which may have been true and therefore may have cut even more deeply than they would have if they were false. And it reminds me that despite negative reviews, opinions, looks, or whatever that I might get on a day to day basis… there are people who get me, and care about what I do. And the same goes for you, reading this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second thing is that it reminds me that even some of the things I’ve created that I didn’t even care about that much resonated with some folks quite deeply. Even posts from this blog that I wrote haphazardly have been re-shared when I didn’t think that any re-sharing would’ve happened. It supports the idea that I should keep creating, even if what I make isn’t that great, or even if not everyone likes it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the third thing it does, and this is crucial, is &lt;em&gt;it instills the habit of noticing my wins.&lt;/em&gt; Everyone could stand to do this, and almost everyone would benefit from it. Once you start noticing your wins, you notice that you win more than you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the losses, while they might stick out in your mind, are usually just a bump on the path to winning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ode To Marble Run</title>

&lt;p&gt;There were so many toys growing up, so many interesting obsessions and fascinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slinky, a world of wonder. The physics that we didn’t need — didn’t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt;— to understand and the joy of watching the mystery unfold right in front of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or what about the view master? With its reels created specifically for the device itself, better than a shake-me-up kaleidoscope, but not quite a personal movie viewing station (yet). Meditative, transportive, and imaginative are all words I would use to describe it. Easy on the eyes too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;There was mouse trap too, an incredible Rube Goldberg machine with clay and chains of motion. A wonder to behold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the best toy of all: marble run. Not because it was a better game than the others but because it was freeing. Little tiny pipe pieces and a marble that starts on one end and comes out on another. Simple, but endless possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we enjoy this process so much, given that we can’t even see the marble making its journey? It’s the set up. The prep work, the building, the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learn from Marble Run that the joy of executing is not in watching the dominos fall. The joy is in the painstaking work to line everything up.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Small Pieces</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-06-01-small-pieces/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever my son eats part of our meal, we cut it up into small pieces so he can use the very few teeth he has to chew the food properly without choking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when I was a teacher, I tried to teach lessons that covered a tiny aspect of one skill. Doing word problems that used two or more operations (like addition and multiplication) was a skill that was spread out over five lessons or so. And the first lesson didn’t involve any math at all – the students simply had to identify what operations they’d need to use to solve a problem. I did this for the same reason that I break up food for my son: it’s easier to chew and digest if the pieces are smaller.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;To get the most flavor out of your coffee, you need to grind the beans into tiny little pieces. The exposed surface area leads to stronger flavors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know this about food and learning. But I feel that this framework is largely ignored when it comes to the idea of moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moments can be broken up into small pieces too, especially if you get easily overwhelmed. I’m someone who can easily feel “taken” by moments in such a way that I need to take them in small moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few ways to do this. Sometimes, I separate the senses. Maybe I’ll close my eyes occasionally and just listen. Or I’ll touch something in the room as an anchor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other times, like in intense conversations, I just have to take it word by word. If I let the words come in too quickly they can bunch up and cause friction in my mind. In beautiful sermons, I’ll sometimes grab on to one word and relish it as it vibrates my ear drum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience of a storm happens drop by drop.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Artists Job Is To Move You In Either Direction</title>

title = &amp;ldquo;05&amp;rdquo;

+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was part of a show recently and so far have read three reviews of it. And even though I was an opener at the show, I was mentioned in all three of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of them said really nice things about me, and it was clear they understood what I was going for with my art. The other one clearly didn’t. And of course, it’s always the one that doesn’t really get it that sticks with an artist, despite the accolades that outnumber the criticisms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I was part of a show recently and so far have read three reviews of it. And even though I was an opener at the show, I was mentioned in all three of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of them said really nice things about me, and it was clear they understood what I was going for with my art. The other one clearly didn’t. And of course, it’s always the one that doesn’t really get it that sticks with an artist, despite the accolades that outnumber the criticisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it made me think: what’s the healthiest way to deal with criticism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is to ask yourself if you actually agree with the criticism. Maybe the thing being reviewed wasn’t your best work. Maybe it was an off-night. Maybe the content didn’t resonate with the folks you were trying to speak to. If any of these apply, then the criticism can be turned into praise. Specifically, _you’re better than this._And you can work toward a better version of yourself for the next run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But occasionally, you’re met with the feeling that you were criticized &lt;em&gt;just for being you.&lt;/em&gt; And some of the greatest bullies in my life have made me feel this way. That, despite my best efforts to be myself and do what speaks to my soul, someone &lt;em&gt;didn’t like it&lt;/em&gt;. Or more specifically, didn’t like &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. That stings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, of course, I am not my work. Someone criticizing my work isn’t necessarily criticizing me. But my art is so much a part of my being that it feels that way sometimes. And as much as we pretend that we can avoid feeling shitty about the criticism, and that it doesn’t matter… it does matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you’re ever in this scenario, it’s important to remember that there’s a weird circular game at play. An artist only makes art that is worthwhile if they are being vulnerable. But it’s the vulnerability, the act of letting someone else into the deepest and darkest parts of the artist’s brain and heart, that makes it hurt so much when the critics start their pummeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, even if for a brief moment, it can make an artist feel like giving up on your art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the solution has always been to continue making new things, and to become &lt;em&gt;even more vulnerable.&lt;/em&gt; And when you do that, it is &lt;em&gt;gauranteed&lt;/em&gt; that at least one person won’t like what you do (probably more). Finding a hater means you’re making good art. If everyone walks away from your art with a feeling of neutrality, that’s worse than getting haters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; art is the stuff that people hate. Like the movie The Room, which is so bad that it became a cult classic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an artist’s job to move hearts and minds. If an audience member is moved, in either direction, then they are moved forever… and the artist did their job.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stories About Skeletons</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-05-30-stories-about-skeletons/</link>

      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen many relatives and friends of mine post this picture on Facebook or other social media sites. I suppose the point of it is that despite our differences, underneath our skin, everyone has the same skeleton. And everyone will eventually become that skeleton when they die. I suppose the message is that we should all love each other as equals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I feel that this image misses something. And that is, we become skeletons when we die, but when we’re alive, we’re covered in skin. And it’s more important to consider who we are and what our identity is when we’re alive than when we’re dead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, this skeleton image is just another way of shutting down the conversation. No one, even if they are bigoted or racist or even just misguided, would deny that everyone has a skeleton. It’s the stories those people tell themselves about the skin that covers the skeleton when they are alive that affects society and progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As humans, we’re narrative driven. Not only do we enjoy stories, but we enjoy creating stories around the people in our lives, even if those stories are highly fictional. I’m a prime example: I once had a boss who I refer to as evil. I still believe my former boss is evil, that she gets off on other people’s sadness and misery while clawing her way to the top. I don’t know her very well, so this is just a story I tell myself based on my interactions with her, and other people’s stories based on their interactions with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the revealing thing about this story is that vulnerability, in all humans, can correct a lot of fictional stories. In my particular case above, I made a lot of judgments in order to sort of fill in the gaps that were missing from my narrative of this person. Why would be so horrible to the people around her? There has to be a reason, and so I invented one and adhered to it with all my might. She’s evil, and wants to see everyone suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s probably not true. But I don’t have the evidence yet to prove otherwise. And so this belief affects every my relationship with every other person with authority that comes into my life, my level of trust with them, and how I engage with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If she had just been vulnerable, and let down her shield… perhaps I would have seen her as a human with flaws, rather than a villain. Perhaps I would’ve been more empathetic towards her if I had known more about her favorite color, or what her fears are. Perhaps our working relationship could have been better if we had bared our souls, even in the smallest way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there I go with the stories again.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Difference Between A Teacher And A Learner</title>

&lt;p&gt;What is the difference between teacher and learner?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could say that learning is the reception of knowledge and teaching is disseminating knowledge. It’s pretty easy to tell in most American classrooms who the learners and teachers are in the classroom. The teachers present themselves differently, they’re usually at the front of the class and the center of attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But can we really think of wisdom as a transaction like that? Is that how it works?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The teachers present themselves differently, they’re usually at the front of the class and the center of attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But can we really think of wisdom as a transaction like that? Is that how it works?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I call you on the phone, I’m certainly the caller and you are the recipient of my call. But after a while, we forget who it was that made the call. We discuss, converse, teach, and learn and our roles are far less static than we initially thought. And in a school or a family, it seems that we should know who is making the call. Who is the giver of knowledge and who is receiving it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly it works bi-laterally. Children teach us just as much, if not more, than we teach them. But is it a transmission of knowledge? I’m not so sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s clear that we’re born learners. That’s hard to argue with. But we’re also born teachers. When my son was four months old, we thought we would attempt to teach him how to sleep. Only you can’t really teach a four month old how to sleep. We drew the curtains, put on a white noise machine, gave him lots of time in his crib… and through lots of crying and frustration, he &lt;em&gt;learned&lt;/em&gt; how to fall asleep by &lt;em&gt;teaching&lt;/em&gt; himself how to do it. I can’t possibly know he did it, because sleeping is the first thing I learned how to do on my own as well. I merely created the conditions necessary for him to learn how to fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, the most fascinating part is that this is how all learning works. There is no transmission. It’s a game of pick up sticks. When I wrote and modeled subtraction problems on the board for my students, I wasn’t transmitting any knowledge. I was simply giving them a structure with which they could teach themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s the difference between a teacher and a learner? Well, I’ve heard before that all teachers are, at their core, great learners. But all learners are great teachers – they have to be, or the learning wouldn’t happen. So while a teacher is not equivalent to a learner, there is a dichotomy to it. Inside every learner is a demanding teacher, and inside every teacher is a curious learner. And when two people come together to learn and teach one another, magic happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning and teaching are just as much internal acts as they are acts of collaboration and kinship.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Bad Cause</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-05-28-a-bad-cause/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever someone creates a fundraiser, they usually follow their financial request by saying that its “for a good cause.” If someone is holding a concert that they want me to buy tickets for, they might decide that the money is going to go toward helping homeless people. They will tell me that my money is going toward a good cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I commend people who decide make the effort to raise money for charity, but I sometimes wonder about what would qualify as a &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; cause. Certainly, whoever is paying for what you might deem a &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; cause must believe it’s a good cause.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It runs counter to the idea we see in the movies or TV shows, where there’s a clear villain who delights in seeing people suffer. In real life, there is much more nuance. There are acts that much of the population deems as a “bad cause,” and yet the person who is behind the cause believes it’s good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what about paying for something, like a car? Isn’t my money going to a good cause in that case, too? Sure, the profits will go to the car company instead of a marginalized group, but that means the company will be able to produce more cars, which is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a bad cause is just one without any effect. Donating to a project that is never finished, for instance. Even if the investment is time or energy, this is most certainly a &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble is that we often can’t recognize a bad cause when it’s being funded. It’s only after we’ve given up on it that the time and money we spent are meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything has a long tail (Donnie Darko didn’t become a cult classic until it was out of theater) and that our creations are still valuable even if they affect &lt;em&gt;one person&lt;/em&gt;. While there is room in life for failed projects, perhaps a value to try and adhere to is to finish what we start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having children, in many ways, is just our version of downloading a copy of ourselves onto a chip (or a cell), combining some of our code (DNA) with someone else, and keeping our traditions, thoughts, ideas, and even physical appearance alive without needing to be immortal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my son was born, I was subject to this kind of thinking: my kid is a copy of me and my wife, a way to remain everlasting. To survive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Having children, in many ways, is just our version of downloading a copy of ourselves onto a chip (or a cell), combining some of our code (DNA) with someone else, and keeping our traditions, thoughts, ideas, and even physical appearance alive without needing to be immortal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my son was born, I was subject to this kind of thinking: my kid is a copy of me and my wife, a way to remain everlasting. To survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he was born, I immediately noticed that he kind of looked like me. He definitely had the same eyebrows, which took up a lot of his tiny face. My wife even noticed that the hair patterns that covered his body (that have now gone away) looked just the hair patterns on my body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when people saw him, they commented on how much he looked like (he now looks much more like a combination of my wife and I), but also how much he looked like &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; dad. It was true. He had the same mouth. The lower part of his face, at least when he was a newborn, was definitely similar to my own father’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we started comparing his baby photos to other people in my wife’s family. It turns out that he also looks a lot like his grandmother (my wife’s mom) when she was a baby, and his lips and teeth look like a lot like my wife. His hairline reminds me of his grandfather (my wife’s dad). And then there are great-great grandfathers who we’ve only seen pictures of and he reminds us of their features too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we say to young children, “I wish you could’ve met your great-grandfather/mother. They would have loved you. You’re a lot like them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in saying this, it dawns on us that our children are not just copies of us; they’re copies of everyone in their bloodline. The code that I’m made of is a combination of the code that my parents were made of, and so on. And everyone shares their code with a common ancestor from eons ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, this disturbs the beautiful idea that we are immortal through our children. If they’re not just a copy of me, but a copy of everyone who came before them (which ends up being a lot of people), then there are other children out there who are also contributing to my immortality. Children I’ve never met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But from this disturbance also emerges an even more comforting thought: we all survive through one another. All of the people we disagree with on Facebook. All the ancestors that we never knew. Those who don’t share our gender, skin color, or values. Those who do. All of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even when the human race is gone one day, and all we have left are the relics of our species, the imprint of our life here on earth will inspire in some micro-bacterial way the next form of life. And our code will continue to produce new code, just as the meteors that crashed into our rocky planet years ago came with the code that made us, the dinosaurs, and everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joyfully and sadly, we are eternally immortal and simultaneously temporary.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Importance Of Being Yourself</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-05-26-the-importance-of-being-yourself/</link>

&lt;p&gt;Most of the positive messages I heard growing up were some form or another of “be yourself.” In my experience, the be yourself messages are rampant the younger you are, and start to change when you get older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because at some point, probably in High School, you’ll get the idea from the adults in your life that yes, it’s good to be yourself, but you’ll probably have to conform if you want to be accepted into a part of society that will help make you a lot of money so you don’t end up homeless and broke.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;And then it’s all about how to understand the norms of the culture you want to join. You’ll learn things like how to give a firm handshake (and you’ll be judged if you don’t), how to play golf, how to “fit in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after I had achieved my first job post-college, I was told to tone down my personality, after bringing a ukulele to work to sing someone a birthday song. The workplace isn’t a place for freedom of expression; it’s about complacency and conformity. There are no room for extra colors, at least in the place I worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so the importance of being yourself comes not as a liberating act, but as an act of battle. You can be yourself only if yourself is congruent with the social norms in your world, or the world you seek to join. And for most people, that’s not always the case. Most of us need to compromise. The lucky few that don’t have one less worry in life. And if you want to be yourself despite not fitting into your group, then everyday becomes stressful. Every day becomes an uphill battle against who you are vs. who everyone else would like you to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I would argue that it’s important to be yourself &lt;em&gt;despite&lt;/em&gt; the fact that it might turn off the groups you wish to join. Because if you do end up fooling those groups into thinking you fit in, you’ll end up living a lie. And they’ll find out eventually. It can’t stay a secret forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that somewhere out there, there’s a group that &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; accept you for who you are. Where you can be yourself as an act of liberation rather than a battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our time is better spent on finding &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; group, instead of swimming upstream to go against our personality quirks in order to create a false version of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because ultimately, the world will be a better place when everyone is exactly where they need to be, doing the work that they need to be doing. And that’s harder than learning how to shake someone’s hand. It requires understanding &lt;em&gt;whose hand to shake&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Crying In A Treehouse Over Processing</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-05-25-crying-in-a-treehouse-over-processing/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the habits of highly sensitive people it seems is to take a long time to process something. I often describe it to my therapist as understanding what just happened when I’m already two miles away. I see the activating event in the rear view but at this point there’s nothing I can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reminds me of George Constanza’s famous line in Seinfield: &lt;em&gt;that’s what I should’ve said.&lt;/em&gt; Only in my case it’s something I should have done as well. I get flustered a lot in the moment, and can often form a more coherent response later on when it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I get flustered a lot in the moment, and can often form a more coherent response later on when it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone asked about this on Reddit, and I decided to respond, not because I believe I have a lot of wisdom on the topic, but because I often learn the best when I’m writing about something. And this was something I wanted to understand more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I realized as I wrote my response is that most of the time when I am processing a certain event or comment for a while it just means I’m over analyzing. I’m ascribing some level of importance to this particular event or comment even though no comment or event deserves so much processing. I have this silly idea that if I think about an already-happened event for long enough it will create some kind of magic moment where all the pieces will fit together and life will make sense again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this never actually happens and I’m often left pondering certain events for years, having rehearsals of arguments with non-existent people in the shower and such. The solution, as far as I can tell, is to spend only an initial amount of time on processing, and then direct my attention elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this strategy requires me to know how to redirect my attention which I believe can be achieved through zazen (meditation in which you sit and practice not attaching to thoughts). That’s work too, and nothing that I’ve come close to getting good at, but at least I can be sure that my time is better spent on learning how to see my thoughts from the outside rather than spend time analyzing them from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put another way: I’d like to fly over the forest instead of crying in the treehouse.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Better Way To Parent With Technology</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-05-24-a-better-way-to-parent-with-technology/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;These days, almost everyone has the ability to use technology to share your child’s personality with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can post pictures on Instagram. We can write stories about our child and the funny things they say on Facebook. Mini-conversations written like plays on Twitter. YouTube videos, like the one I made that went viral a few years back, can show a chid’s budding intellect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the ways in which we use technology around our kids are about putting them on display. And by no means do I mean to discourage this. Those who follow me on Instagram know that I am a ferocious poster of my child’s day to day activities. I can’t help it. I’m obsessed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Most of the ways in which we use technology around our kids are about putting them on display. And by no means do I mean to discourage this. Those who follow me on Instagram know that I am a ferocious poster of my child’s day to day activities. I can’t help it. I’m obsessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, there are many parents who’d rather not share their kid’s life on social media. It’s probably the psychologically healthier option, if I’m being honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But people will say to me sometimes, “Don’t you worry that using technology as you parent will cause you to miss out on what’s actually happening in front of that phone camera?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, I do worry about that. And to be sure, when I take a picture of my child, I see an imprint of him in my phone. When I look at my child, there’s still an imprint, it’s just that I’m using the lens of my eye rather than the lens of my iPhone. It’s not as different as we might think. But it does take me away from being the same present moment as my child, and for that, I resent the way that social media has hooked us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to the question of technology. I have an idea of what I aspire to do eventually when it comes to tech and my kid. And while I am as active as anyone with the baby pics on Instagram, I &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; want to be a parent who sits on a park bench looking looking through their phone as their kid plays. So, instead, the conscious choice to make is between using technology as entertainment, or using it to automate the boring stuff, so that you can focus on being present when it matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a shortcut on my phone (using the Apple Shortcuts app) that auto schedules drop off and pick up times for daycare on the baby related calendar I share with my wife. I also have one that takes a picture of his artwork from daycare and stores it in Evernote, along with his daily reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another automation allows me to use the Amazon Echo to, in one voice command, turn the lights off in my son’s room and simultaneously turning on the white noise machine and humidifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And another shortcut on my phone automatically pays my son’s weekly daycare bill and texts my wife to let her know that it’s been done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all processes that take cognitive energy. That could potentially make it so I spend less time playing with my son and more time doing administrative work around his existence. But technology can solve &lt;em&gt;so many&lt;/em&gt; of these problems in much less time, leaving me with the space to just &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; in the present moment. It’s just that today’s technology also has all that other stuff that can pull me &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; of the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ramping up the useful automation while turning down the need to post another picture could be the way forward.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Hibachi Contemplates Life</title>

&lt;p&gt;I love hibachi food, like Benihana. So much that I always ask to go there on my birthday. It’s like a little journey for me, and the white sauce is nearly &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the moment we arrive, it’s already a party atmosphere. I get to sit next to some people I don’t know, who have annoying kids but seem as excited to be there as I do. Is it someone in their group’s birthday? According to them, yes. But it could be a lie.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Next comes the chef. He’s kind of a dick and he keeps ribbing me and insulting my wife. He does a little performance, and takes a stack of onions and lights some oil inside creating a volcano. There’s also a cute rubber doll he has that pees Sake into your mouth. The jokes about “wanna see an egg roll.” The little concert that he gives with the kitchen utensils. Tossing the knife in the air and catching it before it hits someone in the eye. It’s almost like being at a circus but perhaps a little more niche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s one part of the meal that I really dislike and that’s the shrimp tossing part. Chef goes around the table and flips a piece of a shrimp toward everyone’s mouth, and almost everyone is able to catch the shrimp in one or two tries. Not me. And so he throws a few more shrimp toward me and they bounce off of my nose and onto the floor. Everyone at the table laughs at me like it’s my fault. But that’s bullshit because in this case, my mouth is a hoop and the shrimp is a basketball. And &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; blames the hoop when a shot is missed in basketball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And afterward, the chef bounces off to the back of the restaurant to refill his cart. The steamed rice on my plate is still in the shape of a heart. There’s white sauce dripping over everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the back of the restaurant somewhere, the chef is contemplating his career. The next morning as he’s making pancakes for his kids, he tosses blueberries in their mouth and wonders what upward mobility looks like. It would be nice, he thinks, to work in the back somewhere, to be unseen. To be a phantom chef with no audience. To make food simply for the joy of making it, without all of the theatrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he grabs his tall chef hat, taps his spatula against the kitchen counter, packs a hardboiled egg in his hat, and heads out to the door to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like any other day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the first day of Kindergarten, my teacher told all of us newbies that we were in the process of creating a building. That we could think of each thing we learned as a brick in that building. And by the time we got to the high school, our building would have a roof, and we’d be able to use the building to create new opportunities for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yesterday, I heard the quote that we are the architects of our own experience. The person who said it didn’t know where it came from, but it made me think about that first day of Kindergarten. I remember being excited for the building that I was going to make, and then I got so wrapped up in the brick laying that I forgot about the building as an entity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I remember being excited for the building that I was going to make, and then I got so wrapped up in the brick laying that I forgot about the building as an entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it goes beyond our mind. Since we are nothing more than the nutrients we’ve acquired from the food we at, one could say that we’re the architects of our own experience and we use food as a way to build that experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once saw a documentary on health that pointed out the fact that we have a choice about every single thing that passes our lips and into our digestive system. It often doesn’t feel this way, that we have a choice. For instance, today I’m at a college where they’ve given me a boxed lunch in addition to the healthy oats that I brought to eat. I planned to eat the oats but instead got full on a chicken sandwich with cookies and chips. The exact thing I was trying to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I’m the architect of my own experience, then I don’t think that much about which brick makes the most sense for the strongest building. Not as much as I should think about it. Maybe my teacher should have told us that we will encounter many bricks on our journey, and that the most important skill we can cultivate is knowing which brick to lay and which to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the questions I used to ask anyone whom I respected was: what is the meaning of life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got some interesting and memorable responses from this activity. John Mayer said comfort (which I suppose is arguable). Matt Nathanson said travel (he even wrote it on the dead guitar tuner he gave to me at that show).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all of these interactions have gone as well. For instance, I asked physicist Michio Kaku this when I met him at a book signing a number of years ago. It resulted in him getting mad that I would even ask such a question, which then resulted in me being embarrassed and awkwardly knocking over the entire cardboard display behind me. Howie Day also got mad at me and told me just to be happy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;And honestly, there are no stupid questions, but this one &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; kind of a stupid question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not in an obvious way. Sadhguru, an Indian yogi and mystic, once said that it’s fascinating that we want a meaning in our lives. Wouldn’t it be a relief, he says, to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have any meaning in your life? To let the life happen and play it out exactly as it would, without searching for a meaning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I think that since we’ll never actually get an answer for this, any answer we have for the meaning of life in any given moment is the right one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, we have this yearning to figure it out as if it will help us in some way. Is life too mysterious that we need to tie up the loose ends? And is that why everyone was angry at the end of the TV series LOST?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this: an insect doesn’t search for the meaning of life. They do the things they were meant to do by letting their biology dictate their choices: mating, pollinating, eating, and whatever else they’re programmed to do. One could argue that we’re humans, and therefore there’s a certain level of sophistication that we should aspire to in order to keep society alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re probably right. Without a pre-frontal cortex, without the mechanic with which to think through our choices and question the deeper meaning of existence, we’d all be sex crazy pleasure seeking animals, and at the same time perhaps nurturing and protective parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, we can separate from our thoughts if we want to. We don’t have to identify thoughts as ours, but rather as a process of our body’s internal mechanisms. We can look at that pre-frontal cortex not as a magic power, but as part of the animal that we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we do this, it becomes clear that there is no meaning to life, at least not one that anyone can tell us. The meaning of the life, then, is about as important as the final note in an opera. It’s not the part you really remember or tell your friends about. It’s a punchline that isn’t even funny, in a narrative that isn’t even conclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a beautiful, beautiful mess.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What We Can Learn From Opsimaths</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to think when you look at the news and other media, that early achievement is expected because of how celebrated it is. Build a successful business in high school and no doubt that a local paper will write about you. Graduate from high school and go immediately to work for Google, and you’re a genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if this isn’t you? What if you graduate college or high school just as directionless as you were when you started? Considering that &lt;em&gt;nearly half&lt;/em&gt; of the current generation (Generation Z) has zero idea of what they want to do with their lives when they “grow up,” it’s pretty clear that this sort of direction and success so early is a rarity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Considering that &lt;em&gt;nearly half&lt;/em&gt; of the current generation (Generation Z) has zero idea of what they want to do with their lives when they “grow up,” it’s pretty clear that this sort of direction and success so early is a rarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the pre-frontal cortex that is responsible for high level planning and decision making doesn’t fully develop until around age 25, most folks feel as if they don’t have a direction, or even worse, that they are worthless to society because they never found and executed on their passion. This is a horrible though pattern that can creep along with a person their entire lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An opsimath, on the other hand, is a fancy term for a “late bloomer.” Someone who takes up painting late in life for instance, or starts a baking business after years of being a financial advisor. But even the term “late bloomer” is demeaning, because who is to say that these folks are “late” with their skills? If they’re successful, it seems to that that they’re _right on time._An opsimath doesn’t have to be famous as a result of their skills, either. It’s the development of a new skill, “later in life,” that qualifies one as an opsimath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we can learn from an opsimath is that it’s important to stay curious, not just for our own well being but for our usefulness in the world. We need to stop thinking that because we haven’t achieved our &lt;em&gt;big thing&lt;/em&gt; yet, that it won’t ever happen or that each year it becomes more and more of a distant dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One small shift that teachers and parents can do in this regard is to stop recommending careers for their kids. Instead of saying, “oh you’re great arguing, you should be a lawyer,” you might say “oh, that’s a great argument. How can you refine it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that move, we take the focus off of an end goal and put the focus on the here and now, the present moment, the skill that is being developed. It’s enough to stop there, and it’s something that all children can experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, don’t aspire to &lt;em&gt;be someone someday&lt;/em&gt;; aspire to &lt;em&gt;do something right now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>7Am In The Office</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t really miss that my desk job that much. I say “that much” because occasionally there are times when I wish I could just sit in the air conditioned cube watching the world outside and listening to streaming radio while doing something mindless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is that I don’t really miss the work or even the environment that much. It’s little things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the fact that occasionally, we’ll say rarely, I used to come in before anyone else. I’d get to the office early at 7:30, maybe because I had to leave early or there was some special reason. And instead of turning the lights on, I’d keep them off.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;And then I’d sit at my computer and look at the empty cubicles. The people that occupy these cubes would be here in just a few minutes, but for the moment the world was quiet and still. The breakfast place downstairs still hadn’t opened. There wasn’t an ephemeral click clack sound of keyboards in the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on those hard drives at their desks, all the spreadsheets that have yet to be tabulated, documents yet to be written, code yet to be entered. Emails yet to be sent, meetings yet to be scheduled. It was as if I was frozen in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting time to yourself in general is quite a luxury but getting time to yourself in an office full of people is a miracle. I’d sit and just stare at the black monitor screen, looking at my reflection and pondering life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to experience awareness? It’s a darkened office before the crowd rolls in. It’s the stillness in the air before the day takes off. It’s the beauty of silence in a noisy place. The dimness of the room in what is normally well-lit by generic florescent lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the peaceful stillness is interrupted by the second person arriving: “Hey, why are the lights off?”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Sense Of Humor</title>

&lt;p&gt;A phrase I’ve heard throughout my life is: “Have a sense of humor.” The way that people say it is almost akin to the way they offer a breath mint: “Here, take one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can’t offer someone a sense of humor that way. A sense of humor is developed, like any other sense. I wouldn’t turn to you if you didn’t enjoy a concert and say “have a sense of hearing!” Or if you didn’t like the art in a gallery, “have a sense of vision!” I may instead perhaps try and introduce you to elements of a painting that make it interesting from my point of view, or have you listen to music with really nice headphones to appreciate the subtleties.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This also means that having a sense of humor &lt;em&gt;isn’t the same&lt;/em&gt; as being funny. We often hear the two things conflated. Being funny is an act of creativity, of surprise, of connecting two unlike ideas together in such a way that it seems obvious in retrospect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a sense of humor is more like a compass that can be used to tune in. Amusement is the state or experience of finding something funny or entertaining. Let’s emphasize that word, state. Unlike being funny, which requires a habit of thinking creatively, getting into a “state” simply requires certain triggers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that almost anything can be funny if you think about it in the right way. It’s partially the reason why monks, when they achieve satori or enlightenment, find that the only thing they can do is laugh about it. Perhaps it’s the seriousness with which they took life before enlightenment in contrast to the new of way of looking at things. Enlightenment could be, then, a sustained state of amusement, or an elongated sense of humor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t “have” a sense of humor any more than you can “have” a sense of vision. It’s there, within all of us, but only activated under the right circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is what I shall practice every day: getting the circumstances necessary to achieve a sense of humor.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Wonder Of Magazines</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-05-17-the-wonder-of-magazines/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During my social media fast during the month of March, I found myself less interested in my phone when I was bored, say, sitting in a waiting room. So in these cases, I would usually resort to listening to music, or leaning into the boredom, which enhanced my creative thoughts and spurred new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in waiting rooms, I noticed something that I hadn’t really noticed in a while – magazines. The interesting thing about magazines in today’s world is that they don’t need to be create click-baity headlines. Now, I’m not referring to the ones you see at the grocery store, because those have &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; been clickbait. But the ones you find in say, a psychologists office, can exist on their own, without the need to draw you in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Now, I’m not referring to the ones you see at the grocery store, because those have &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; been clickbait. But the ones you find in say, a psychologists office, can exist on their own, without the need to draw you in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leafing through the magazine, I found some interesting articles about how nutrition is related to mood. I noticed that these articles were long form, they weren’t listicles. They weren’t out to try and get you to keep scrolling down a page. And more importantly, the content didn’t feel forced. The pictures weren’t covered by pop-up advertisements. I felt like I could concentrate on an article longer than I could with a Medium post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There really is something about high quality paper, too, that enhances the experience. We could chalk this up to aesthetics, but as James Clear explains in his book Atomic Habits, making an activity attractive and satisfying increases a person’s motivation to continue the habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And pictures. When was the last time you looked closely at a photo on a physical piece of paper instead of your screen? Because the screen as a medium as its limits. With paper, you can adjust the quality and go for a particular effect. It’s more effective than the filters we put on our Instagram posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I made it a little quest to go to Barnes and Noble and find some magazines that interested me. I got some on Zen Buddhism, philosophy, art, and creativity. What I found when I got home was that I had spent hours on the couch just simply reading. Not flicking through a feed, not getting distracted by some email or text notification … just reading, in peace. Time flew so quickly that I had forgotten to cook dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And things I learned from the articles were far more interesting than reading the (essentially) same post over and over on Medium. For instance, I read about how to create a sensory garden (a garden that is constructed for the purpose of engaging all 5 senses). It was in a magazine about creativity and well-being, and while there are many podcasts and blogs that pontificate about this subject, this was the first time I was exposed to this particular concept of a sensory garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature by which we read magazines is inherently different than the nature by which we search online. With a magazine, there is intention. I sit down and intend to read the articles inside. Online, I spin the wheel and hope that whatever shakes out is valuable. I go online to find &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, anything really. I go on to get my fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I read a magazine, I become curious. Not just playfully curious but actually curious. It’s this type of curiosity that I believe will save us in the age of click bait and listicles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Chef Consumes Three Meals</title>

&lt;p&gt;The first meal happens during the preparation process. Even though onions will sting the eyes, and garlic will make the hands smell for hours, the chef begins with an appetizer eaten not with her mouth but with her eyes and hands. The feeling of dough being rolled. The crispiness of carrots being chopped. The whirling colors and sensational textures. In preparation of cooking, a chef eats her first meal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The feeling of dough being rolled. The crispiness of carrots being chopped. The whirling colors and sensational textures. In preparation of cooking, a chef eats her first meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second meal is consumed by the ears and the nose. As the onion and garlic hits the pan and starts to cook with a &lt;em&gt;hiss&lt;/em&gt;, the aromatics start to fill the room. There were aromas before, too, but these are more pronounced. As if they mean business. The buns in the oven are causing the house to smell like mom’s kitchen. The fresh herbs that have just been cut are leaking out incredible fragrances into the air. And with this, the chef consumes their second meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the third meal? Well, it’s consumed with the chef’s mouth of course. But not in the same way as those for whom she has prepared the meal. Because the chef has the memory of the first two meals, the third meal is a dot on the i, or perhaps a celebration of the process of cooking. Eating what you’ve made, as every artist knows, is one of the most satisfying experiences that one can have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to aspire to be a chef. It’s a choice you can make when you truly use your sense to consume the three meals. Your food may be better than other chefs or much worse… but you will have nourished your mind as much as your body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if that isn’t the point of cooking, I don’t know what is.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How To Be On Time</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve struggled with a number of organizational things in my life. When I was a kid, my backpack was a mess, and I never knew when anything was due, never studied for tests or quizzes and never knew when anything was happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve addressed many of these issues through systems that I started building in college and continued building after I graduated. I write a lot about these systems in other posts. But one thing that I &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; struggle with is being on time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I’ve addressed many of these issues through systems that I started building in college and continued building after I graduated. I write a lot about these systems in other posts. But one thing that I &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; struggle with is being on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel as if there are three main reasons for this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My family was late a lot when I was a child and I never experienced any kind of confrontation about this habit from any friends and family. Maybe it trained me to think that there are no consequences to being late.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can’t time things in my head properly. I sort of kind of have an idea of how long it will take me to get ready, then get to the car, then get on the road and drive to my destination. But a vague idea is not good enough for these purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I assume that being on time means I should arrive at the event start time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got a new job two years ago, my success was based on my ability to show up on time and be reliable. So I needed a new set of internal rules. For those who are on time frequently, these rules will seem kind of obvious. But for the rest of us, it’s not obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solutions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I first had to accept that being late, even by a little, was probably affecting someone, somewhere. Even if the person I’m meeting or engaging with didn’t have anywhere else to be and anything else to do, waiting for me is going to be a waste of their time. And even if it’s 5 mins of downtime, then it’s really a waste, because starting a task in that short amount of time wouldn’t gain enough momentum to be efficient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had to plan to leave super early. At least 30-45, preferably 60. Usually what happens is that some of that extra time is eaten up by something I forgot, or changing my shirt because it’s torn, or whatever. Another 10-15 might get eaten up by traffic. And in that case, I’m still early and I can sit and read a book while I wait. I remember saying to myself, probably better to assume that being on time actually means being early. Then I remembered that that’s actually a saying and conventional wisdom that I apparently never listened to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I made both of these things a habit, I started getting to places on time. I’m rarely late anymore, and in fact, most of the time people are impressed that I’m sitting in the waiting room right before the appointment is supposed to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest roadblocks I experienced with trying to be on time was the anxiety of getting to a location early. I figured it would feel like a waste of time. But realistically, that time buffer is eaten up most days. And on the days they’re not, I entertain myself while I’m waiting by writing a blog post or reading something on Medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the result? Most of the people I work with see me as reliable. And that is 95% of the battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years ago I switched careers from being a teacher to being a trainer. What is the difference between a trainer and a teacher anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn’t much. The biggest difference seems to be in semantics, that teaching is more related to academic or personal skills, and that training is related to careers and jobs. In other words, teaching will benefit the individual, but training will provide skills that benefit an organization of some kind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But then, when our son was born, I discovered a plethora of advice about sleep which is referred to as sleep training. As he’s a baby, I doubt very much this will contribute to his career one day. So I return to the idea of training, and I think about the root word… train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A train isn’t decisive. A train only knows where it’s going because someone laid down a track. I didn’t invent the idea of sleeping for instance, and I didn’t invent the idea of learning how to fall asleep, so in training my son to sleep, I’m simply showing him where the tracks (that someone else laid down) are and letting the tracks guide him along the way. And actually, in the case of sleep training, I can’t even really show him where the tracks are – I can leave him alone and create an environment where he can train himself to fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And anyway, I’m not sure how I would instruct &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; on how to fall asleep, let alone someone who can’t understand what I’m saying and doesn’t have the emotional capacity to reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly though, in the time that my son has been alive, I’ve gotten on track with a number of things. My health has improved due to eating better quality foods. My productivity has skyrocketed, which has allowed me to nearly finish the book I’ve been writing for the past year or so. And I work out three times a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve done all this in spite of being a new dad, because I’ve ruthlessly &lt;em&gt;removed&lt;/em&gt; things from my life that shouldn’t be there, like excessive social media use and hanging out with friends that I don’t particularly care to hang out with. I didn’t ever need to do this before, but my child… well, I guess you could say that he’s trained &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; to compartmentalize my time better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for good reason too. Not only do I feel like I haven’t lost sight of my goals in life, but I also feel that when I’m with him, when I’m taking care of him or putting him to bed or just playing with him… I’m fully present. I’m not thinking about all the work I have to do, because I’ve already done the work or I’ve accepted that it won’t get done today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It means that I can be as present as I need to be to ensure that I do my share of parenting and house maintenance. And by no means am I saying that I have mastered this. I have weeks where I don’t get work done, weeks where I shirk responsibility, as we all do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But… that’s how training works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re on the track until you fall off the track. And then it takes someone or something, whether it’s a mentor or just that internal voice, to tell you to get back on the track and keep moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teacher training is an interesting place to be in August. Right before the school year starts, teachers are a bit more relaxed and they have a natural curiosity and sense of exploration as they begin to tackle the new school year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one school in which I taught, we were asked to analyze some articles as part of our pre-service (meaning the professional development we do before students arrive). We were then asked to pair up and discuss the articles using a discussion guide. The guide would walk us through a discussion where would make assertions, arguments, and agreements about different parts of the article.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We were then asked to pair up and discuss the articles using a discussion guide. The guide would walk us through a discussion where would make assertions, arguments, and agreements about different parts of the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one rule in our conversations that was new to me was this: when we shared our thoughts, only one person was allowed to speak at a time. And they had a full two minutes to say their piece before the next person was allowed to speak (this was managed by a timer). If they fell short of two minutes, we were instructed to “hold the space,” which means to just stay silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely, it makes sense to wait until another person is done speaking, and really make sure they have said everything they need to say. But sitting in silence for potentially a full minute? It sounded unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I was wrong. This configuration taught me two things about how I listen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m usually waiting for my chance to speak. With the rule of not being able to chime in for two whole minutes, I was way more focused on what the other person was saying than on my response. I figured I’d have a little time to think about what I’d say after the two minutes was up. It is rare to have moments like these in conversation, where we truly tune in to the other person without a counter voice in our heads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a person stopped speaking after 30 seconds or so, they’d usually explain “well, that’s all I can think of to say! I guess we sit here awkwardly now.” And so we would sit there awkwardly, and 90% of the time, the person would chime in with extra thoughts about 20 seconds later. The process taught me that silence is necessary to really draw out the juice of our thoughts, and that space can give our thinking definition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I’m having a deep conversation with someone now, or perhaps an argument over something, I pretend that I’m back in summer teacher PD, and I hold the space. The other person doesn’t know that I’m using a structure. All they know is that they feel respected and heard, and that their thoughts are free to develop and grow like vines out of the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I moved into my new house last year, there was an interesting phenomenon that I noticed. Every time I’d mention to someone that I bought a new desk or a crib for my upcoming child, I’d get the response: “I’m sure you’re super busy and I’d love to come and build it for you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought it was just my incredible generous friends and family offering their time to take some of the burden off of my wife and I. And surely it was, at least partially. But no one was chomping at the bit to help us more our furniture, or scrub the bathrooms… overwhelmingly, they simply wanted to build our furniture that we had purchased from Ikea or Wayfair.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But no one was chomping at the bit to help us more our furniture, or scrub the bathrooms… overwhelmingly, they simply wanted to build our furniture that we had purchased from Ikea or Wayfair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a theory as to why this is. It’s the same theory that I have about kids and a traditional math class, which is that when you provide the steps to do something, and those steps don’t require learning a new skill, the process is incredibly enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare building a piece of furniture to designing a website. With website design, unless you’ve been handed a rough sketch, the shape of the thing will shift as you build it. Sure, there’s an immense payoff when you’ve finished the project, but the wondering, the revising… all of it is cognitively taxing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With furniture building, once you’re done, you have a new desk or bed or shelf. It’s immediately functional and useful. Unless you ran into a missing part or perhaps some directions that were poorly written, the process was fairly straightforward. Meditative even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With building furniture, you can go into a Zen like state. You’re not reading Facebook statuses or trying to write a term paper. You’ve got an end goal, and the end goal is necessarily satisfying (unless you’re building something you won’t use, in which case, why?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The near desperation with which people would ask me to build my furniture was striking. It makes me think that everyone is looking for an escape, and a project like furniture building is not something you can just go out and &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;. It coincides with a friend or family moving, or perhaps your own need to replace something in your house. In some ways, it’s the &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; route to escapism. So it makes sense that people would be practically begging to do it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figure this is true for them because it’s true for me. Whenever I’m asked, I clutch my escapism close to my chest like a pearl necklace, take a deep breath, and say… no thanks, I got it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Richard Bransons Morning Routine</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m a huge fan of routines in general. I learned as a teacher is that routines are comforting to children &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; adults. It seems obvious, yet we rarely think about how we can use routines strategically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One popular way that designing a routine has become a bit more mainstream is the idea of a morning routine, or the actions we take when we rise each morning. Drink a warm glass of lemon water, do yoga, write in a journal, eat a small meal. Do it every day when you wake up, and your day will continue to have some kind of structure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It’s become a trend lately for people to post these routines as YouTube videos or blog posts. Seems like it’d be helpful, but it’s actually nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s why: the benefit here is not knowing the components of someone’s routine, it’s just &lt;em&gt;having a routine in the first place&lt;/em&gt;. Knowing what comprises Richard Branson’s morning routine won’t help us – the things he does in the morning reflect his own values and needs. Doing what he does won’t make us in any way like him, any more than eating 3000 calories a day like Michael Phelps does won’t turn us into Olympic athletes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So make a morning routine, yes, but don’t model it after anyone else’s. Especially someone you admire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have everything you need in your brain to determine the right structure for your life. The key is consistency, not influence from others.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Joy Thieves</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-05-10-joy-thieves/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Don’t let anyone steal your joy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a phrase written in permanent ink on the teacher’s board in the copy room of a school I worked at. It made sense for a school setting for teachers, who have their joy stolen constantly by basically everyone, including people outside of their job who think they understand their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, I was convinced not to let anyone do this to me. I figured a good attitude could keep it from happening. But then it happened. At one point my joy was stolen. I won’t get into the specifics of how, but the joy of what I did every single day was deliberately stolen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;If your joy gets stolen, there is a way to get it back. There is a way to reclaim it from whatever entity took it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, joy can’t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; be stolen, even though the saying goes that way. Instead, it’s more like it’s extracted. Joy is confidence, joy is frictionless… but when joy is extracted by someone or something malicious, the residue is often a sticky mess of fear. And it’s not the type of fear that keeps you up at night. It’s the type of fear that causes inaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone does this, the result is often that we stay stuck. When I got my joy stolen from me as a teacher, and it made me want to quit. This is the ultimate goal of joy-thieves, who often have had the joy stolen from them first, and they have nothing better to do but to ensure that the cycle continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we want to reclaim our joy, we must take action anyway, despite the residue of fear. We can’t quit, because then we risk becoming a joy thief ourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our joy thieves never actually win. They lost the game a long time ago. But until the day that we are driven to steal another person’s joy… there is still hope for us yet.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Phases Of A Party</title>

&lt;p&gt;You haven’t felt this for quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re at the party and it seems to be endless. Due to the nature of the fact that you’re intoxicated and also among your best friends, time seems to slow. Not to mention you’re younger, maybe in your 20’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music’s loud, the booze is everywhere, there are people in a bedroom next door to you doing something or other, and in another room there’s a dance party of two. And all the while, you wonder if this is life from now on: working for the man and having get togethers on the weekend. No one’s ready to leave because no one has kids to get home to, and in fact, no one here really has a pet either so this could go on for a while.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But at some point, the party dwindles, and it happens slowly. People leave one or two at a time, and eventually the energy has gone from thunderous wave to quiet waterfall. Perhaps a poker game has emerged at 3am, and the drinks have gone from beer and vodka to scotch and wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When or how you fall asleep is hard to say, but it does happen at some point. To everyone. Sleeping arrangements aren’t really arrangements at all; in fact, sleep itself is simply a fast-forward to morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which, when you wake up and find that everyone else has either snuck out earlier in the morning or is still fast asleep, is absolutely &lt;em&gt;stunning&lt;/em&gt;. It feels good to be up early, even though you’re groggy. You pour a glass of ice water and wonder why you’d ever consider drinking anything else than this silky pure goodness making its way into the arid tunnel of your throat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You sit at the kitchen counter. Was the light always this beautiful coming in? It feels a bit like you’re sitting atop a mountain and watching the light play off of the valley. You’re not alone, but you’re in solitude. You realize how much you like solitude, which is an odd realization to have in a room of crowded and unconscious people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this moment happens again and again, party after party, until you realize that the thing you crave the most from these get togethers is the morning light, and you might as well skip the drinking and dancing and scream-talking and just wake up early to catch the light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And by the time you figure this out, you’re well into your 30’s. And it’s just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Comfort Of Consistency</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a few videos I’ve seen floating around the internet that are really fascinating to me. The videographer has captured a moment that happens daily or weekly, and it always happens the same way. For instance, here’s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3elVe9Mlh8&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of a professor who walks into his classroom in the same way every day, saying “Hello” while holding a stack of papers in his left hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWHStQsai04&#34;&gt;another one&lt;/a&gt; a sibling picks up their sister from school, and she greets them the same way every single day – by shouting their name and running toward them. It’s super cute.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I find the public’s fascination with these videos fascinating in its own way. Why do we like videos like this? What is so interesting about them? Is that they’re slightly hypnotic? Watching the professor walk in the same every day is almost comforting, when you watch it for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if there’s a name for these types of videos, but I’d label them as “consistency porn.” The comfort that humans get from consistency is really astounding. So much so, that when I was a teacher and we were taught to provide consistency, we’d go as far as to make sure that if there were any changes to our classroom, that we rolled them out slowly so as not to upset the kids. It turns out that changing a kid’s environment too quickly can feel unsafe to the child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rhythm, a balance, the feeling of certainty… all of these are soothing to children. And if something is soothing for children, then chances are it is also soothing to adults. Why we pretend to grow out of such needs is a mystery to me. Ask anyone in your life about the importance of consistency, and they’ll all have some kind of daily routine that keeps them sane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to watch these videos, as cute as the content can sometimes be, is really a mind journey to a place of comfort. It’s a reminder that underneath all the stresses of daily life, there are little pockets of certainty and consistent action that keep our world turning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many times have you asked this question: “What should I get [person] for their birthday?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, when I’ve been asked about what someone might want, I’ve usually responded with, “Why don’t we ask [person]? Seems like the easiest way to know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I recently attended a lecture by Austin Kleon that made me think twice about this. Kleon talked about giving art as gifts instead of constantly seeking the validation of the market. It made me think about the nature of gifts to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;For instance, should we solicit gift requests? And what is the true nature of a gift? Should we buy things that people want? Or should we buy what we &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; they need?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems inefficient to buy people what we &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; they need: after all, there’s a good chance that we’ll be wrong. Isn’t that money wasted?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps. But there’s an alternate point of view: what if the gifting experience is not about the gift itself but about the interaction, and the exchange between two friends or family members? If you think back on the gifts you’ve received, the functional ones may stand out in your mind. But for everything else, it was probably the experience of receiving it. The warmth, the feeling of receiving generosity from someone who genuinely thinks you matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That we’ve equated gifts with going to the mall and spending money is our own fault. When did we let someone else define what shopping for gifts meant to us?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Minimum Effective Dose</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How many Advil do you take? I ask people this question whenever they ask for medicine at my house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people say two, but the minimum effective dose, which is the minimum amount of the medicine needed to remove your pain, is only one pill. There’s a chance that people are confusing Advil with Tylenol, which has an MED of 2, according to the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to drugs, chances are we over do it more often than not. How many YouTube videos before we heal ourselves from a shitty day? How many Doritos to quench our craving at a party? How many glasses of wine does a romantic evening make?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Values Are Icebergs</title>

&lt;p&gt;A classic feature of Facebook these days is the endless and circular arguments people get into. I’m a proponent of conversation, of debate, of thoughtfulness. But I rarely see arguments on Facebook or Twitter achieve anything useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persuasion doesn’t have to be a zero sum game. If I have a belief and you challenge my belief, I might counter-challenge and we might both emerge with a better sense of the issue due to being exposed to two varying perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;One of the classic types of arguments online (and in person) are the ones where people clash on values. In other words, it’s less about some kind of intellectual exercise in debate, because the goal isn’t to persuade or be persuaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Values are not arguments, and though they might inspire debate, values are relatively immobile. Values, like ice bergs, seem to take quite a while to reshape themselves. And it’s likely that it isn’t words that can change values, only _your_life experience can do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So once again, the answer seems to be the same as it is for any conversation or relationship – use technology to maintain, but use face to face intellectual discussion for deepening. All the nuance of face to face discussion that we leave out when we relate online makes the whole exercise a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Power Of Bedtime</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-05-04-the-power-of-bedtime/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the first four months of my son’s life, we let him sleep whenever he felt like it. It didn’t matter whether it was noon after lunch or 3am, if he was up, he was up, and if he was going to sleep, then there was absolutely nothing we could do stop him. This was developmentally appropriate for a newborn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After four months, we’ve become much more cognizant of his naps. We don’t want him to get too much but we also don’t want him to get too little. But the biggest reason is that he now has a &lt;em&gt;bedtime&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;For the first four months of my son’s life, we let him sleep whenever he felt like it. It didn’t matter whether it was noon after lunch or 3am, if he was up, he was up, and if he was going to sleep, then there was absolutely nothing we could do stop him. This was developmentally appropriate for a newborn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After four months, we’ve become much more cognizant of his naps. We don’t want him to get too much but we also don’t want him to get too little. But the biggest reason is that he now has a &lt;em&gt;bedtime&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 7pm, we begin to wind down. We eat a little bit, we bathe, we read books, we listen to music, we play gently and then eventually he gets put in his crib and he’s off for the night, sailing through dreamland until 7 or 8am usually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We broke his habit of falling asleep whenever he wanted to by creating this bedtime routine. It seemed hard to believe that a baby would buy any of this, but the signals make him realize that he’s going to be asleep soon and so his mind starts to prepare. It’s almost like clock work at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is, there are some who never had a bedtime. And I find, anecdotally, that it is those people who have the hardest time falling asleep, or at least having a consistent bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which bring us to an interesting point. We were &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to have bedtimes as kids. When did we stop?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, it was high school and college. Since teenagers appear to be wired for night work anyway, I got into the habit. There were, of course, college nights spend staying up way too late writing a paper that was due the following day. Somewhere in there, I lost bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I rediscovered it again recently. Sometimes when you’re in the 30’s, your mind just suddenly starts talking to you and telling you that it’s time to go to bed on time, or eat healthy salads every day. And it’s been telling you that since your mid-20’s but now you’re finally tuning and ready to obey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one day you start going to bed early around 10:30, so that you can wake up early because you have a job or kids or something, and then it becomes routine. So you eat dinner at 8:30pm. You take a shower and read. You play guitar. And, with all these singnals, your body starts to shut down perfectly, just like my son’s does at 8pm. Like clock work. No fighting insomnia, no bleary eyed Netflix binges… just wonderful, refreshing sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing what I know now about bedtime, like seeing the clouds from both sides… I’ll never go back.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During teacher training six summers ago, we were tasked with analyzing what we were bringing to our teaching practice. Specifically, what baggage we were carrying from our experience as students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were asked about our favorite teachers, and what made them our favorites. Lots of responses seemed to indicate that a good teacher had a little bit to do with teaching skill, and a lot to do with personal connection. The truth is you can’t have one without the other. Good teaching goes beyond chops, it necessitates personal connection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;During teacher training six summers ago, we were tasked with analyzing what we were bringing to our teaching practice. Specifically, what baggage we were carrying from our experience as students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were asked about our favorite teachers, and what made them our favorites. Lots of responses seemed to indicate that a good teacher had a little bit to do with teaching skill, and a lot to do with personal connection. The truth is you can’t have one without the other. Good teaching goes beyond chops, it necessitates personal connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were also asked about our least favorite teachers. What they did to us. The overwhelming shame many of us felt, specifically around math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mine was my seventh grade algebra teacher. I had been placed in his class because of a score I got on a placement test. I must’ve been extra alert that day for the test because I definitely did not belong in his class. And that was apparent after a few weeks of straight up failing quizzes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no one asked me to transfer. Back then, being in a higher math level was more important than being in an appropriate math level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I even worked up the courage one day to go into his room on my lunch hour and ask for help. It took a lot. It was spring, so I had been failing miserably for months. My mom has convinced me it would change everything. And he even encouraged to the class in general, even telling us that “no one ever comes” during lunch for help, and he eats a tuna sandwich every day by himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I came in and asked for help on the homework. I’d rehearsed the lines and everything. And you know what he said?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to go over that in class. Can you wait until then?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d never felt more stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is what I was bringing to teaching. This feeling of shame and lack of care from a teacher who was probably doing his best but not meeting my needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sat in silence in training that summer, writing these kinds of experiences down on little slips of paper. Then, we were instructed to crumble these papers and throw them into a big trash can in the middle of the room. The act of physically throwing these papers away was therapeutic, not because it made me forget or separate from the memory of my teacher, but because that day, I made a conscious choice through action to leave my own hurt and trauma out of my classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My students would be better for it. And I’d eventually learn that I &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a math guy who had been in the wrong place at the wrong time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trash can thing can be done before new jobs and first dates. It turns out that throwing hurtful memories physically into a real trash can is a &lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt; way to begin any relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Dangers Of Turning Classic Books Into Classic Movies</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started reading the Harry Potter novels when I was about 14. The movies came out soon after and I vowed to wait until I’d finished the books before watching the movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trouble is, those images of the actors from the movies were everywhere. And due to priorities, there were years that went by between the book and movie releases and when I actually read and watched them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I picked up Book 4 at age 24, the movie in my mind was hugely influenced by the movie images that I’d seen on trailers and online. When Harry spoke, I imagined Daniel Radcliffe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So when I picked up Book 4 at age 24, the movie in my mind was hugely influenced by the movie images that I’d seen on trailers and online. When Harry spoke, I imagined Daniel Radcliffe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a terrible disservice movies do for book lovers. They do the heavy lifting, giving readers a physical world and a definitive look for the characters. They rob the reader of the joy of imagination. What’s left for the reader brain to do? Just go through the story, I suppose. And even if we haven’t seen the movies, those images are everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did manage to combat this a bit by listening to the audio books, which are read by the incredible Jim Dale, who somehow managed to transcend the movie images and create a side world for me. One where I could imagine the details from scratch using only Rowling’s words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Wrinkle in Time was different. I will alwyas read that book and imagine it the way I imagined it the first time I read it. Despite Zach galifinakis playing the happy medium, or Oprah playing Mrs Which, the movie didn’t shatter any of the imaginative elements I created when I first read the book. And that’s probably because Wrinkle in Time was a &lt;em&gt;bad movie&lt;/em&gt; while the Harry Potter films were actually quite good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems inevitable that classic books will always be turned into movies at some point. But I wonder how we can strike the imaginative balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, after all, a movie in our minds when we read. We play the director, producer, casting agent, and grip. And inviting another film crew into your mind’s production creates an alternate experience that could be less rich – especially if they know what they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Punishment By Youtube</title>

&lt;p&gt;A recent trend on YouTube are kids filming themselves punishing their children. In one of these videos, a father filmed his daughter walking to school from his car. He explains, at the start of the video, that she had been bullying other kids on the school bus and therefore had been kicked off the bus, for the second time in one week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A recent trend on YouTube are kids filming themselves punishing their children. In one of these videos, a father filmed his daughter walking to school from his car. He explains, at the start of the video, that she had been bullying other kids on the school bus and therefore had been kicked off the bus, for the second time in one week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The daughter seems to be unaware that she’s being filmed, and the father is giving the camera a monologue about how unacceptable bullying is, and how he’s against kids thinking they’re entitled to things, like being able to ride the bus in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the only video I’ve seen like this. Usually in these videos, the parents are making some kind of statement to other parents. A suggestion, perhaps, to other parents about what they &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be doing to take responsibility in teaching their child discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I believe this kind of video can backfire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the video of the girl walking to school instead of taking the bus, the consequence of her actions was already delivered. Since she couldn’t handle herself on the bus, she now had to walk to school. With the father driving behind her, filming her, and telling the entire world about her misdeeds, he might be making a point about parenting, but at the expense of publicly shaming his child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children make mistakes, and there should be consequences. As a teacher, we were taught to deliver logical consequences (if you break something out of anger, you’re responsible for fixing or replacing it, for example)… or natural consequences (if you’re fighting your friend and you both fall and hurt yourself on the pavement, you’ve already experienced the negative consequences of your action and no further intervention is required).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the bus driver had given this girl a logical consequence: if you can’t be cordial on the bus, you don’t get to ride. The only thing this parent was doing was publicly shaming his child and trying to position himself as some discipline authority. What he was really doing was riding on the back of someone &lt;em&gt;else’s&lt;/em&gt; consequence as if it was his own method of dealing with the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps he was embarrassed by his daughter and needed to prove to the world that she didn’t learn bullying behavior from him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But either way, the habit we’re getting into of publicly shaming our kids on the internet when a normal consequence would do may curb their behavior, but only so that they don’t end up being publicly shamed. It doesn’t teach the bully about the feelings of the person they’re bullying. It also opens up a girl’s chosen punishment to input from the rest of the world. And we definitely don’t need any of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Videos like this go viral and are promoted by USA Today, but since every child is different and every situation is different, they add very little value.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How To Find Your Inner Voice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve always thought that the idea of an inner voice was a little bit over the top. When I was at the peak of my religious phase in 8th grade, I read the book &lt;em&gt;Conversations with God.&lt;/em&gt; The idea of this book, if you don’t know about it, is that a man gets really mad one day and starts to write a letter to God, and to his surprise, God writes back… through him, by manipulating his arm and forcing him to write a response.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Of course, after being in kind of a wondrous phase with the book, I came to understand the truth which is that this guy is delusional or perhaps a great con-artist and is writing religious fan fiction. But Oprah and Barnes and Noble and everyone else ate it up. Even my freakin’ Grandmother read Conversations with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were to look at it through a lens of optimism, perhaps I’d conclude that he was simply hearing his inner voice for the first time, and &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; it was God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever attempted to access your inner voice? Mine will sometimes emerge when I’m alone with no reading material, like in the shower, or sometimes on a long car ride (of which I take many for my job). It’ll say all sorts of wise things and calm me down if I’m anxious. And it’s super reassuring because, since the voice is coming from within, I &lt;em&gt;believe it&lt;/em&gt; when it says everything is going to be okay. It’s a weird sort of duality, but it seems to be an efficient mechanism for self-help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I hadn’t been successful at just accessing it whenever I felt like it – until my therapist taught me how to do Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It happens in five steps. First, you have some thought or event that makes you distressed (I failed a test). Then, you state your belief about it (I’m stupid and will never get anything right). Then you state the consequence of believing that (feeling depressed and stupid and negative toward myself). After that, you dispute the belief (maybe I’m not stupid, maybe I just didn’t study well enough or it was just a tough test). And finally, the way the dispute made you feel (well, that makes me feel better and not so dumb for a minute).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see this process as two voices taking turns. Imagine a wise old version of me, talking to day-to-day me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wise Zia: Your boss didn’t like your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zia: I’m a failure and will never live up to my boss’ expectation. I feel low key shitty all day thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wise Zia: What about all the times you succeeded and your boss noticed and acknowledged you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zia: True. That makes me feel slightly better, thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the inner voice isn’t really an inner voice at all. It’s just the voice that kicks in when you start to dispute the negative beliefs about yourself and your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If so, perhaps wisdom is simply the ability to give ugly thoughts a beautiful makeover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I look at the comments people make online, and I wonder how they got so closed minded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll watch Facebook debates between two politically divided people. No one’s mind is ever changed, and the arguments become circular with each person feeling more and more &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; after each jab. How is it possible to have an argument where both parties believe they’re &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; correct after each disagreement?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

How is it possible to have an argument where both parties believe they’re &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; correct after each disagreement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a clue can be found in the terms open-minded and closed-minded. An open mind has yet to be shaped by any events or preconceptions; a closed mind is a house built on experience, trauma, connection, and pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not necessarily bad to have a closed mind. My therapist told me that making the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; choices in life depends on how tightly you’ve defined your values. And what is the process of defining values if it isn’t closing your mind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, as an example, I decided that if I ever got a tattoo on my body it would say YMMV, which stands for Your Mileage May Vary, which means that we all have different experiences. That’s a value. I’ve decided to believe in it. I’ve closed my mind a little as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think it’s possible to prevent this from happening, actually. As we move throughout our lives, our minds are constantly moving from an open state to a closed state. That’s inevitable. The question, then, is not how we can be more open minded. The question is how we can put ourselves in a position to allow our minds to be easily changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may have closed my mind at a rate that is typical for a 34 year old, slowly at first in grade school and then accelerating a bit in my 20’s. I’m as closed minded as anyone else, because I’ve had enough life experience to justify the things I believe. But to change my mind? It’s a lateral move, not a vertical one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can have a closed mind all my life about, say, a political issue and then over time have my beliefs slowly change. I didn’t approach anything with an open mind, because that’s impossible. You can’t untie the shoe that’s been in the process of being tied for 34 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can change its texture, its color. You can change the way you walk, the way you kick the stones on the road you’re paving. You can’t easily have an open mind, but you can easily change your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language is so important. All my life I’ve heard “have an open mind” as if it was finger food at a party. It would be wiser, instead, to teach our children to let their minds change without resistance. That doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t question what we believe, but that we shouldn’t trick ourselves into believing that we even &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; open our mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because in the process of allowing the world to change our mind, we also allow our mind to change the world.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, I was obsessed with hurricanes and tornadoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If there’s ever a tornado warning,” my mother told me with wide eyes, “then we’ll have to head to the basement where it’s safe. A tornado watch means we just need to be alert.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I developed the belief that if there was ever a tornado warning, that we were doomed and the house was going to be crushed by a twister. I was so obsessed that &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; time the sky turned dark, I would pick up the phone (in the 90’s the internet wasn’t as helpful) and dial my local weather call-in number, which would play back a recorded message. A low growly man would tell me whether or not imminent doom was possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I was so obsessed that &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; time the sky turned dark, I would pick up the phone (in the 90’s the internet wasn’t as helpful) and dial my local weather call-in number, which would play back a recorded message. A low growly man would tell me whether or not imminent doom was possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so worried that I felt the need to seek out as much information as possible about hurricanes and tornadoes. My mom, aware of my interests, bought me some books on natural disasters, and even after reading those I’d have millions of questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the summer, if I ever looked outside and saw a pitch black sky in day time, I would go into panic mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no surprise that I would later develop anxiety. Even though I was never officially diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, I know anxiety and all of its tricks quite well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A book I’ve been reading recently, Stopping the Noise in Your Head by Reid Wilson, breaks down the mind’s incoming data into two cateogies: signal and noise. Signals are important to pay attention to, they lead to a solution of some kind. Noise is unimportant and should not be paid attention (note that this is not the same as ignoring or trying to block out). A signal is that you got a low grade on a test; noise is that you are stupid and will never pass the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about my weather anxiety is that I began a thought pattern when I became obsessed: I wanted as much information as possible in order to find some modicum of control. I obviously didn’t want to die in a tornado, but my brain created this noise, this need to check the weather constantly. Yes, it’s good to be informed if your area has a tornado coming, but obsessively checking even if there’s simply a violent thunderstorm outside is a form of anxiety, or trying to control that which cannot be controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In doing so, I trained my brain to constantly look for threats. While I moved from seeing a dark sky and freaking out, other things would come up. A new noise on an aircraft would mean that we were going to crash. A high level on a blood test would mean I would certainly die within the next year. Hypochondria developed after this, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I realize now is that most my worries are a bit like my obsession with the weather. I look for information, scour the web for opinions, and freak out about the doom and gloom while selectively ignoring any positive cases. There’s a great quote: I am the sky, not the weather. It’s a great reminder that at any point, no matter how much rain there is, and no matter how many tornadoes have been spotted nearby…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…weather conditions in my mind are optimal, because I am the sky above the weather.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ill Never Write Another Song</title>

&lt;p&gt;I’ve written before about how songs seem to come to me gift-wrapped. That is, they’ll appear out of nowhere, fully formed with a melody and a core idea, and it will take very little refining on my part to beat them into shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some truth to the idea that inspiration is spurred by simply sitting down to work. I’ve written some songs this way, like when I have a custom song to write for a wedding and the deadline is soon approaching. The downside to this approach, of course, is that some of those songs are ones that I’m not inspired by and I never play again. Some, very few, become hits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;There is some truth to the idea that inspiration is spurred by simply sitting down to work.

The downside to this approach, of course, is that some of those songs are ones that I’m not inspired by and I never play again. Some, very few, become hits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my best songs seem to come to me in the car or the shower or walks, when my mind is fully untethered and I am able to access parts of me that I wouldn’t otherwise be able to. And there’s a feeling each and every time that &lt;em&gt;I will never be able to write another song again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feeling is further exacerbated by the long swaths of time that come in between songs appearing. I don’t try to write a song day, though I may start to do that soon as an experiment. I imagine it will go a bit like my deadline based songs, and that I’ll get some great ones and some throwaways. I’m guessing it will spur songs that I wasn’t expecting and will ultimately help me write more songs that go into my sets and albums. But this feeling that I’ll never write another song again still plagues me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not the same with blogging, which seems require less complex skills: every day, I simply go to my list which generally has 100-150 blog post ideas and I pick one and start to write. I have a similar list for songs, but there are extra components, like a good melody and rhythm and style, that slow this process down. It’s not just about lyrics. That would easy if it were, at least for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s not even the complexity that slows me down. It’s the fact that I also feel this way about good days, the ones that I mark as my favorites in my journal. It almost feels, when they’re over, like they’ll never happen again, like that was the last one I’ll experience for a long time. Or that if it does happen again, it could never as good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course, this is all a huge misunderstanding. I will write a song again, and I will have amazing days. The trick is that when this feeling arrives, I just accept my fate as a fire-less artist and move on. And inevitably that good song or good day comes along anyway, whether I worry about it or not. It’s no use thinking about what will or won’t happen in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should really know that by now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Do You Write A Song</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first time I wrote a song I was seven years old. My parents had recently gotten a piano in our basement and I made up some simple melody on thee piano that ended up being performed at my piano recital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My teacher had told me a secret: you can play any song you want, as long as you know the notes. I figured the same must be true for songwriting, except… how do you know the notes to a song you’ve never heard?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Well, the truth is that you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; heard it. Deep in the tiny nooks and crannies of your mind are the seeds of every creative idea you’ve ever had. The ideas come in racaous and flamboyant, you think to yourself, ah, cool… and they wedge themselves into some corner of your mind never to be looked at again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To write a song, you need to &lt;em&gt;listen&lt;/em&gt;. There are no other skills required. If you know how to listen, songs will come pouring out of you like wine from a bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for what to listen to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music is vibrational energy. The best way to inspire vibrational energy through listening is to hear the timbre of the various sounds in the world around you. Listen to bird song, hear the scraping of someone’s foot against the pavement, the sound of the school before any of the kids arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to all kinds of words. Melodic and rhythmic words, poems, weird words, common words (especially common words, because they hide a lot of meaning in their wings). Play with words constantly, and pretty soon the words will be coming out of your pen and onto paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to music. Music with lyrics or instrumental, it doesn’t matter because every song tells a story. Listen to heavy metal and classical, tango and bop, ambient and smooth jazz. Find the pairings that no one’s ever heard before and let it speak to you. Then, tell its story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to the noises a persons’s face makes when you play your music. Did you succeed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how you write a song. Not by creating output, but by noticing input.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie A Life Changing Album</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was 1998. I was living in Egypt and I had taken up acting and singing at school and finally felt like I had a place in my community. For the first time ever, I was accepted (or whatever the closest version of accepted is in middle school) by a group of peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My best friend at the time considered himself a playwright, but I didn’t take him seriously until he submitted a play under a pseudonym to a contest at a local university. He won, which meant his play was to be produced, and I went with him to the auditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t really tell anyone about our age (13) at the time, and I actually auditioned for a role in another short play and got it. So I spent time traveling between my home in Maadi and the American University of Cairo, which was a cab and metro ride away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My co-actors and director didn’t know how young I was. They all assumed I was a college student, but I had a full goatee at age 13, so they were very surprised to discover that I was actually a child. Thankfully they didn’t judge me too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a college girl who was in the play with me and she used to drive me home each night, because she lived near me. We’d talk about all sorts of things and every week she’d play the same record on the way home: Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie by Alanis Morrissette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was only kind of familiar with Alanis – I knew all the hits of course, but this album had about 18 songs and some cut bone deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That I would be good,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if I gained 10 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That I would be good even if I did nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That I would be loved, even when I’m not myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That I would good, even when I am overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you India,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you terror,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you disillusionment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you nothingness,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you frailty,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, thank you silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Unsent, her unsent letters to exes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Terrance I love you muchly you’ve been nothing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But open hearted and emotionally available and supportive&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And nurturing and consummately there for me I kept drawing you in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And pushing you away I remember how beautiful it was to fall asleep&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On your couch and cry in front of you for the first time you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were the best platform from which to jump beyond myself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what was wrong with me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Jagged Little Pill being an album full of amazing lyrics, there was something different about her follow up. It was almost like she was spilling herself onto a page, and singing her feelings in a way that was so authentic it made all the other artists I was listening to at the time sound bland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was her lyrics that invited me to write poetry with a new lens. My 8th grade English teacher was surprised at how mature my poetry was in her class… she didn’t know that it was because Alanis inspired me to be raw, and myself, and unencumbered. She helped me learn to speak to my own heart. And eventually that led to me writing my own songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank u, Alanis. And thanks Tamara for the gift of this monumental album.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Art As Gift</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Seeing Austin Kleon tonight at Politics and Prose was highly enjoyable. He has such interesting thoughts and I love his books. Not to mention, his blackout poetry is really creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things he said that really stuck with me was the idea of making gifts. That we we will sometimes see a friend’s good art and then say that they should make an Etsy store or, in my case, try out for American Idol.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But in the ancient days, art was made for communication and beautification. The whole idea of folk music, I suppose, was a communal and shared experience. It’s why acoustic guitars exist: you don’t need amplifiers or electricity. We’ve made pickups for acoustics of course, but the acoustic guitar as a concept is made for small rooms and porches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the father who draws his child a cartoon and puts it in his lunch bag every day, we should nourish those around us with our art. I suppose that’s what I try to do here, with a daily blog. I end up writing so many pieces that are so varied in scope. Each one is for a different person in my life though I don’t ever tell them. Perhaps I should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because ultimately this is what the distinction is between good art and bad art: good art was made for someone specifically. Bad art is made for everyone, and therefore no one.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Fear Of Happiness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you were to review the tapes of my life, all the books I’ve read, the podcasts, the movies, the lessons I took away from those movies… you’d think that I was doing whatever I could to seek happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And actually, maybe that’s most of us. Not everyone is into the genre of self-help, but most people I know are trying to help themselves through whatever possible means. An old friend of mine got into Jiu Jitsu in order to better his physical and mental abilities. That may not be equivalent to reading Tolle but if it isn’t self-help, I’m not sure what is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

An old friend of mine got into Jiu Jitsu in order to better his physical and mental abilities. That may not be equivalent to reading Tolle but if it isn’t self-help, I’m not sure what is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the happiness that we seek is hard to find. Do you know anyone that’s gotten there? I don’t. That doesn’t mean that I don’t know happy people, but all of them attempt to better themselves in one way or another, all of them are dedicated to the process, to the journey. Happiness, or the idea of it, becomes more like a carrot than a treasure chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we were to really dig into it, what would we find happiness to be? Is it a stress-free life? I don’t think that’s what I’m after, and I don’t know many people who I think would say that is what they’re after either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because achieving a stress free life would mean no more challenges. And we need challenges. And if it’s not a stress free life after, then maybe happiness is simply an attitude that we wear, the notion that we can handle anything, that bad thoughts and events will come and go we’ll still be standing… until we aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dark side of this is that many people actually &lt;em&gt;fear&lt;/em&gt; this kind of unconditional happiness. That their dissatisfaction is what drives them to make change in their lives and the lives of others. That if they were to be unconditionally happy, oddly enough, there would be no reason left to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So perhaps we’ll settle for a middle way: being perfectly and unconditionally happy with never really being happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a street near me named Noyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a child, I thought that this name was pronounced “no yes,” which I found funny and contradictory. What was this street name that was both negative and affirmative simultaneously? It sounded as if someone was changing their mind and it was captured in the form of a street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I know better, I realize that It’s pronounced like “noise” with a soft s sound at the end. It is named after someone, though I am not sure whom, and internet research hasn’t given me a sufficient answer. But I did find a handful of people that the street &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be named after.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be a reference to Alfred Noyes, an English poet, who wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the highwayman came riding—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riding—riding—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of no-yes in this poem. The tension that is created with the beautiful images of the night sky against words like ghostly and darkness and gusty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, perhaps Noyes is a reference to Clara D. Noyes, an American nurse who headed the American Red Cross in WWI. Nurses tend to say yes to those in distress and no to their own needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, perhaps it is a reference to Dorothy Noyes, who writes about tradition and folklore in the context of history. Many of the stories contained in folklore have elements of no-yes. They leave a reader questioning their own morality, despite occasionally containing a moral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so every time I see this street now, I say to myself a quiet “no-yes” and it brings me a tiny sliver of peace. It reminds me that, to any question, there are binary answers, and then there are transcendent answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No-yes is not an answer that satisfies. Instead, it nourishes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many people, when they enter my home, notice that I have four echo dots scattered across my house. At first, they wonder why I would need so many echo dots, until they see how I use them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;multiple cooking timers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to-do list entry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;disable/enable alarm system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;turn off lights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;change intensity of lights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;turn on devices like heaters (and then having them automatically turn off 30 minutes later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are ways to accomplish all of these things without an Echo dot, but it sure makes it easier to do things with voice when my hands are otherwise occupied by children or typing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;li&gt;turn off lights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;change intensity of lights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;turn on devices like heaters (and then having them automatically turn off 30 minutes later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are ways to accomplish all of these things without an Echo dot, but it sure makes it easier to do things with voice when my hands are otherwise occupied by children or typing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, they get further annoyed when I show them all the Shortcuts I’ve built (in the iOS shortcuts app):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a 10 second process to send a thank you email for a baby gift, complete with an animated gif&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a button that sends a text to my daycare provider and calculates the time it will take to get there as a variable in the message, along with a map of the quickest route&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a button that takes a picture of my son’s daycare report and puts it into an OCR notebook with one tap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people have claimed that “all this automation” is going to make us dumb. That with all of the ways we can make tasks happen more quickly, we’re losing the ability to have patience that builds up with process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But consider that all of the people complaining about automation making us dumb use automation daily to accomplish their goals. It’s just that &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; automations have become commonplace, almost to the point of necessity. You use a car instead of a horse to get around, and Uber if a car isn’t available. You use a pencil to draw rather than finding a stray stone and whittling it down to a point. You use a computer every day at your job instead of writing everything by hand, you send email instead of letters, and you use a credit card and a bank to store your money instead of putting cash in a hiding place in your house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automation serves us and solves problems in our lives. It’s not just for efficiency though that is a huge benefit. How much more time do I get to spend on the things I truly love and automate the rest? When I was a teacher, the question I asked was how much time do I get to spend doing the creative act of teaching and less on the reports and administrative stuff? People would make fun of me for how much I automated, but I guarantee I had more cognitive energy to teach than I would have had otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t believe smart technology is making us dumb. More likely, it’s making us numb. We don’t even realize how useful it is, so we make up narratives about how it’s making us worse off. This doesn’t include social apps like Facebook and Twitter, because those actually take up more of your minutes with unnecessary clicking than does enabling your alarm system with an Echo dot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness around how technology is used is key. Intentionality around using it to allow more time for the things you truly value in life (which tend to be non-technology related things). It’s why we automate in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Only Time I Hate Music</title>

&lt;p&gt;About a decade ago, I posed the question to my Facebook feed: do you know anyone who actively dislikes music?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one responded. At least no one responded with evidence of someone that actively dislikes music. Sure, there were some who disliked &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; forms of music but no one seems to just dislike it altogether. Even religious sects that think music is evil seem to form their beliefs tribally, in the same way that eating pork is a sin to a Muslim but they don’t, as a culture, dislike its taste necessarily.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Even religious sects that think music is evil seem to form their beliefs tribally, in the same way that eating pork is a sin to a Muslim but they don’t, as a culture, dislike its taste necessarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I start to pontificate about why music is so universal, I always come back to how music as a communication tool is not much different from language. After all, speech has melody to it, and an improvised one at that. We speak in a variety of tones when we communicate, and we use those tones strategically to persuade. We speak in rhythm too, a lot of the time, and when we don’t it becomes hard to follow thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those short clear sentences your English teacher talked about in Hemmingway embodied a natural rhythm. I only wish my literature teachers has connected the idea of prose to musicality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, come to think of it, there is a situation that occurs when I dislike music. It’s not a particular type of music, and in fact it may not even count as actual music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the residue of music. That is to say, when the frequencies are isolated. It happens when the neighbor is blasting loud techno at 3am, and all you can hear in your apartment is the &lt;em&gt;thump thump&lt;/em&gt; of the bass. Or if a car drives by and you hear the bass line of some reggae. To me, it feels like I’m being tapped on the shoulder repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also won’t like music when it appears unsolicited. I’m not talking about overhearing a concert in the distance as you walk along the beach. I mean, when you’re sitting in your backyard listening to birdsong and a nearby neighbor starts blasting Bach. It’s music out of context, and for me, music tends to serve a purpose. If I wasn’t expecting it, and if the context isn’t right, I usually don’t enjoy it. Even if it’s a genre or type of music I like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those are rare occasions. For the most part, music remains essential to my life and is functional in many ways, that I’ll talk about in a later post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the residue from other people’s music consumption that I try to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the message we sometimes get when we’ve reached the end of our latest updates on Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook. When I first saw this in my feed, I thought that the creators of these networks were trying to do some good. To let me know that it’s &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt; to stop scrolling and to close the browser window the play in the physical world for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after my social media fast last month, I’ve realized that it’s quite the opposite. And the way in which this is actually a manipulation tactic is clear from the words I use to explain it above: “they &lt;em&gt;let me know&lt;/em&gt; it’s okay to stop scrolling…”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In other words, these kinds of notifications are there to grant me &lt;em&gt;permission&lt;/em&gt; to stop scrolling. How terrifying that we have become so hypnotized by our social media apps that we defer permission to &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; in order to know when it’s time to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to know when it’s time to stop. It’s not when you’re “all caught up” on your social media. It’s when you’re “all caught up” on &lt;em&gt;everything else&lt;/em&gt; that is important to you. The kids, the dishes, sex with your partner, enjoying a summer breeze and a whiskey, traveling through time in an immersive video game… whatever provides joy, and is an intentional choice, compared to the mindless slot machine that is social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the secret is that once you’re all caught up on everything else, you don’t need digital slot machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve already hit the jackpot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember the first time I saw this stargazey film. I was really into ambient music at the time, and the philosophy of creators like Brian Eno, who believed that sometimes we create art that is meant to let our mind drift, the way he did with his famous album Music for Airports (and many others that followed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first time I had met up with my parents since I had gone to college. It was still relatively early in the year, October I think, so things were just cooling off but we were in that lovely in between period (at least in terms of the weather) between summer and fall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I remember leaving the film feeling a way that I never felt leaving any other films. Instead of what I normally felt, which was however the ending had left me, I had felt like the entire film washed all over me, and I was covered in its residue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My two favorite scenes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Bill Murray whispers something into ScarJo’s ear at the end, but we can’t hear what it is. I love this because when I revisit this scene at different times in my life, I’m either deeply curious about what he says to her, or I don’t care, or I don’t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to know. It changes every time, which is an effect that I believe a good film has on a viewer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When ScarJo is killing time and walking around Tokyo. She’s poking at things, and looking at foreign art in almost a meditative way. It’s a scene that goes on longer than one would expect, but the scene does for the viewer what the experience does for the character: it makes us feel like we’re children, exploring the environment around us. Very few movies accomplish this.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>I Failed Art Class</title>

&lt;p&gt;I was told in elementary school that I was probably not an artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, my teacher didn’t explicitly say that. But the grades I got on art projects were always low. I remember creating a painting once about people who looked like mushrooms living in the woods. I thought it was interesting, and clearly it was since it’s memorable to me years later. The title was “Save the Mushrooms” and I’m not exactly sure why. I got a C-, and I can’t remember the reason for that either.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The title was “Save the Mushrooms” and I’m not exactly sure why. I got a C-, and I can’t remember the reason for that either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way that art class worked was that the teacher would model some kind of artistic technique (paper mache, water colors, pastels, etc) and we would try and make some kind of art based on what she was doing. I’d try really hard, but my hands wouldn’t coordinate, or my paint would be too watery, or my paper mache wouldn’t stick or my toothpick structure would fall apart before I was even finished. I don’t know what my issue was exactly, but it was clear to me that I didn’t have much artistic talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they didn’t teach us is what I had to learn later, which is that you can’t teach art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That art is the result of intuition, inspiration, observation, and bravery. And you can’t teach those things. Just like learning how to sleep when you’re an infant, no one can actually teach you how to do these things; you can only try to create an environment where these types of habits flourish. And you can model them. So I didn’t learn much in her class. I still can’t draw to this day. And what I learned when I published my first book &lt;em&gt;Closer to the Surface&lt;/em&gt;, which is a collection of poetry and paintings is that you don’t need to be a technical artist to produce art. You can just do it. You don’t need permission because permission destroys good art. Think about every monumental piece of art ever and the crowds of naysayers that had to be shunned in order for the artist to change the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was one thing I learned from art class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my report came home, it always said something along the lines of how I was still struggling to produce art that made sense with whatever confines she had given the class, but that I was “very helpful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And helpful I was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the only lesson from art class that I took with me, and it was a simple one: how to clean up small bits of things. I use this skill anytime something shatters, or any time there are so many small pieces that it’s hard to pick up by hand and there’s no vacuum nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You roll a piece of sticky tape around your fingers, so it’s in a loop and the sticky part is on the outside… and then you press your fingers with the tape wrapped around it down into the mess. The little pieces will stick to the tape, and you can replace the tape when its full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s saved my neck many times. The lesson I learned is that you can’t teach art. You can only teach a process, but the process isn’t the point. I’m not an artist because I connected the dots or picked up tiny pieces off the floor with tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m an artist because I decide that I am.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gifted And Talented</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was in elementary school, I was labelled “gifted &amp;amp; talented.” What this essentially meant is that I had shown some level of acquiescence to the policies and procedures set forth by my school. I achieved decent grades and was seen as a high achieving student. I eventually ended up winning some kind of academic award signed by the president (Bill Clinton at the time) and at the awards ceremony all of the parents took pictures as the 6 of us held our awards.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I eventually ended up winning some kind of academic award signed by the president (Bill Clinton at the time) and at the awards ceremony all of the parents took pictures as the 6 of us held our awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But many educators have realized the fallacy here, which is that &lt;em&gt;all students are gifted, and therefore have the potential to be talented.&lt;/em&gt; Said another way, we all have gifts, or natural inclinations that make us valuable to the world. And we all have challenges that live right on the other side of those gifts. It’s on the adults in our life to recognize these double edged swords and teach us to use them appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone who talks a lot in class is also a great verbalist. What if we let them create YouTube videos instead of writing a paper silently to express the same point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone who is physically aggressive is also confident. What if we channeled their aggression into some cause that was important to them? And what if they started a non-profit one day as a result?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that everyone has a gift, but that gift is a seed. And we as parents, teachers, and educators can water that seed and can facilitate its growth, which then leads to talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one day when people tell us that we have talent, we can correct them and say that we &lt;em&gt;acquired&lt;/em&gt; talent as a result of someone noticing our gift and encouraging us to cultivate it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes after I play a gig, a sound engineer or someone from the crowd will approach me and tell me that they’d like to work with me and potentially record my music. I took someone up on this once, and we ended up with a pretty nice result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I get Facebook messages that are similar. I once received one that said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey! I loved your music. I didn’t hear anything professional on your site so let me know if you want me to produce anything for you.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;“Hey! I loved your music. I didn’t hear anything professional on your site so let me know if you want me to produce anything for you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got defensive immediately and fired back asking what the person meant by “professional.” They clarified that they meant “radio-ready,” which in the audio world equates to &lt;em&gt;loud&lt;/em&gt; so it can stand out against other tracks. But it pissed me off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who was this person, and why were they trying to get me to believe that my tracks weren’t worthy enough of approval from the mass market? Some more assumptions they made: that I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to be on the radio, that the radio even matters anymore, and that I’m only a songwriter with no vision for how my music should sound on a record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I produce my own music, aside from one track that I did with a producer, and I always have. Even from age 15, I spent a lot of my time on an analog 4-track recording my music. I eventually evolved into a pretty nice studio set up in my basement, along with synthesizers and other instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My recordings are mixed, recorded and arranged by me. I could almost certainly get a more professional results by industry standards if I were to work with engineers and producers… but my tracks have the element of &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; in them that would be diluted a bit by others joining in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They may be rough around the edges sometimes, and perhaps they wouldn’t stand up to other tracks on the radio or on a discovery Spotify playlist… but I’m okay with that. There’s this assumption that music should be made to be sold and to be consumed by as many people as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe music should just be a unique expression of the artist, whatever that means. Whoever shows up to listen is the audience, big or small, and by the end, we’re all changed for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1987, Paul Janet put forward the idea that when you’re one year old, a year is 100% of your life. When you’re 2, a year is reduced to 50%, and so on. It’s why car rides are so long for young children, and why waiting for summer break can sometimes feel like an eternity when you’re young but then three fly by in what seems like an instant as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It’s why car rides are so long for young children, and why waiting for summer break can sometimes feel like an eternity when you’re young but then three fly by in what seems like an instant as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apparent length of a period of time is proportional to the total time you’ve been alive. If you were to map it on with a line, you’d see your life compress toward the end, creating a logarithmic type of function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some benefits to this. For one, you don’t need to wait as long for things to happen. We teach kids patience at school and at home, but maybe it’s not patience that’s needed… instead, maybe it’s just &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; and plotting ourselves farther along the x-axis of the logarithmic function. My wife and I will sometimes plan events a year in advance, and while it seems it’s far away, it always approaches (and then is over) fairly quickly. I notice this with fun parties too. I show up and in seemingly just a few seconds the party is over and everyone is going home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare that to those nights in college that seemed to just go on forever and ended with Chinese takeout in a dorm lounge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downsides are somewhat obvious – life will feel a lot shorter than the years it takes to live would have you believe. Time just seems to slip by because every day becomes a lot more uniform, especially if you work at a desk or have the exact same routine every day. For those with kids, a huge downside is that your perception of watching your child grow is &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; shorter than their perception of how long it takes to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But David Eagleman, a professor at Baylor College, says that there’s a way to combat this. Not a way to live longer, but a way to expand the perceived length of time. And that is to seek novelty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This draws upon the fact that as children, everything is new and novel. Our perceptions of a year change but things also become more familiar. So if you seek out new and novel experiences as often as you can, the length of perceived time it takes for a year to occur should slow significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I think about parenting, I realize that part of being able to enjoy the ride has to do with seeking novelty. They say it goes by so fast, and they’re correct. But the choices we make during the ride about what activities to do every day and how far we stray from normalcy should have an effect on our enjoyment and fulfillment. And that’s worth pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started working out years ago, I bought myself a set of rubber bands and a few dumbbells and got the latest fitness book from Barnes and Noble. I don’t think I actually made much progress, but there were still benefits, such as learning how to do certain exercises that I hadn’t learned from high school gym class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when my wife convinced me that we should both go to a fitness trainer, and I agreed, I found out that there is a real benefit to having a coach vs. going it alone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I don’t think I actually made much progress, but there were still benefits, such as learning how to do certain exercises that I hadn’t learned from high school gym class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when my wife convinced me that we should both go to a fitness trainer, and I agreed, I found out that there is a real benefit to having a coach vs. going it alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, the coach can give you on the spot feedback. Sure, you’ll get some feedback working alone, but it will mostly come in the form of pain/injury a few hours later. Instead, it seems to make sense to be told, in the moment, what you’re doing incorrectly. Maybe it’s form or maybe it’s how you’re actually performing the exercise, but either way, you end up being more efficient when you exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And mental fitness is quite similar, I believe. A lot of people will do meditation alone with an app (or not), the way that I bought rubber bands and a book at first for my fitness regimen. But just like physical fitness, having a coach really helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A therapist, for instance, can help you recognize negative thought patterns and teach you new ways to wire your neurons to overcome these negative thought patterns. Because this is mental work, and the brain is really good at trickery, it is even more beneficial and effective to work with a professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mental fitness is just as much about form as is physical fitness. I’ve been trying to use the type of thinking outlined in the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy guidelines. I’ve created an automation for it on my phone and everything. The idea is to challenge your negative beliefs, which causes a brief moment of calm, and over time this will result in new patterns of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I was doing it wrong. Instead of appreciating the moment of calm, I’d assume that my dispute with my negative beliefs would lead to the negative beliefs being removed my brain immediately and forever, which my therapist described as wishful thinking. I’d then get mad that I still had negative thoughts, feeling like I was failing and starting all over again. When I found out that the “effect” of disputing your negative beliefs is that you have brief moment of calm, and that you have to dispute those thoughts again day after day, it changed how I viewed my mental fitness practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, I now see it as just that: a practice. And practice makes us more efficient, but a &lt;em&gt;coach&lt;/em&gt; supercharges our progress.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Being A Novice Is Fair Game</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first started playing guitar and piano, every note and every chord were fair game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started programming, a simple print hello world program was fair game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started working out more regularly, every exercise and even type of weight was fair game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is: when did the most basic elements of a practice become unfair game? It probably happened when we started challenging ourselves to become more adventurous and try expanding our skills. But why does it feel cheap to act like a beginner?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Why does it feel inauthentic to write songs that use the most basic chords, or yoga poses that are used by novices?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the antidote is to instill the belief that &lt;em&gt;everything is fair game.&lt;/em&gt; If true, it means that we can grow in our skills while still finding meaning and value in the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s why lullabies are sometimes the truest music of all, despite the fact that they are simple. There is something about simplicity that soothes hearts and souls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it’s completely normal to &lt;em&gt;miss&lt;/em&gt; being a novice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Re Imagining The Birthday Card</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-04-11-re-imagining-the-birthday-card/</link>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-04-11-re-imagining-the-birthday-card/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote a month ago about my complicated relationship with birthdays. About how it’s an important thing to celebrate a person and I’ve traditionally been bad at it. So I came up with a unique idea for a business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a list of everyone that you’d like to celebrate. Let’s say no more than 50-100 people. Enter those names and physical addresses into the website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At some designated start date, preferably New Year’s Day but it really doesn’t matter, you get on your account and type up a birthday message for every person on your list. All at once. The site might have some prompts or structure (haikus, memories, etc) for you but ultimately the messages should be personal. They should truly celebrate the recipient, maybe with a picture of the two of you that’s special or something. But we are chunking here. All messages will be done by the end of the day and you pay your yearly fee to the company at this point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then the company will print and hold your cards until someone’s birthday comes along at which point they will send the cards out to reach them on the right day. The cards will be gorgeous and interesting and moving and personal, unlike anything from a grocery store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a re-imagining of the birthday card. Physical but not silly. Intimate but not campy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a re-imagining of the birthday card. Physical but not silly. Intimate but not campy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could see the argument that it feels better to send a card on the actual day but most people don’t do that anymore. Instead it’s a quick and standard text or Facebook post. Nothing wrong with it but we can do better. Those quick posts happen because we seem to be too busy in the midst of our lives to send actual cards. Some still do but most do not, by my estimation. This is a tangible product, and a way to bring back a wonderful tradition without the weekly stress of sending a card (because it would be weekly otherwise! Or even more frequent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A real connection on someone’s special day. What else do you need?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Functional Lemons</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was at a restaurant recently with a few friends, and I ordered a Diet Coke. It came in a glass with a lemon wedge on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I love when my Diet Coke comes with a lemon wedge,” I said. “I think it’s because you get to smell the fresh acidity of the lemon scent as you sip.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So why do regular cokes never come with lemons?” my friend asked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;“So why do regular cokes never come with lemons?” my friend asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a good question, and from what we could remember it seemed to be true. Diet cokes seem to come with lemon, while regular cokes just come in the glass without any kind of garnish. We hypothesized for a while about why this might be. Perhaps the taste of the sugar in regular coke was sweet enough that the lemon wasn’t required. Maybe the Diet Coke is slightly more bitter and therefore the acidity provides a more pleasant drinking experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, diet cokes come with lemon wedges because for waiters, &lt;em&gt;that’s how they can tell when a drink is diet vs. regular.&lt;/em&gt; So the lemon is functional, but not for the customer. Seems obvious in retrospect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes me wonder how many things I encounter in daily life are invisible indicators. Invisible because they are for someone other than me, even though they exist in plain sight (like the lemon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I was in a school yesterday that had beautiful studio lighting in the ceiling, and a nice wooden floor, with a clean open concept. I mentioned this to the CTO of the school, and he told me that they believe that learning is greatly enhanced by the attention to details. Another silent signal that, like the lemon, is obvious if you’re looking for it, and invisible if you aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was listening to a podcast recently where the hosts were discussing the idea of little experiments one conducts in their daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, say that I want to lose weight. I might spend a month doing the keto diet, and then another month eating vegan and another month just staying under a calorie limit, all the while tracking my progress through measurements like waist circumference and body weight. The idea is I could compare the different months to see what was most effective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The idea is I could compare the different months to see what was most effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever done these kinds of experiments, then you know it is very easy to trick yourself into thinking that the insights you gleaned from your experiments, while really fascinating, &lt;em&gt;only apply to you.&lt;/em&gt; In statistics, the idea of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; is that it represents the number of samples/subjects being analyzed in a study. They claim, that in order to ensure the validity of a study, that n should be 30 (though some textbooks say 20 or 50). That if you aren’t looking at least 30 or so samples, you may not have a good representation of the whole population, and therefore your results might be off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you’re experimenting on yourself, that’s a &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; of 1. And the beauty of that is that while you can’t claim truth for everyone in the world (think about fad dieters), you can at least gain insight into what works &lt;em&gt;for you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’ve got n=1, correlation is all that matters. n=1 is 100% successful at uncovering information about how your brain works. And really, what else do you need?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How To Be Sad</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-04-08-how-to-be-sad/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My Nani (maternal grandmother) passed away last night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on something lately in therapy, which is learning how to be sad. It turns out that for most of my life, I’ve avoided the feeling of sadness. Often I’ll skip over sadness and go directly to anger, or I’ll sidestep it and go to a distraction or drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For someone like me, who feels so deeply most of the time, it seems odd that I can’t even relate to the feeling of being truly sad. Sadness has always been like the edge of a foggy cliff for me. I don’t know how deep it goes, and I’m averse to learning more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe it’s more like a space on a board game, and I know what it feels like to land on it, but only briefly before moving on. I rationalize the skipping, and sometimes the rationalizations make a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like, before we boarded the plane for my aunt’s funeral almost a year ago, I told Dezi through the walls of the womb: This is how it goes, Dez. Someone new comes along and someone else has to exit. There’s not enough space in the room and not enough room in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s true but it’s a skip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to commit to being sad. Not forever but for longer than I usually do. I don’t know exactly what that means and there’s no way anyone can prescribe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I do know that what I remember about my Nani the most vividly were the fragrances. The perfumes she wears, if I ever I smell them in public it will take me right back into her arms when I was a baby. Or the smell of her entire apartment filling up with maple syrup and French toast. Or chicken corn soup. Or the windows open in June, with the perfect scent of flowers wafting in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where my Nani lives now for me, in the fragrances of the world and the kitchen. There are some who have passed whose words I remember, whose advice still rings in my head. But she transcends all of that, she comforts in the way that a garden comforts. In the way that you can be in solitude, in a beautiful and fragrant place, and still somehow feel like you’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think of life and death as two sides of the same coin but maybe life is a bridge between two types of non-existence. In our culture’s funerals, the men huddle together and a core group hold up the coffin, which is heavy. We take turns, passing the coffin to new hands, while others take a break and walk alongside. Then those original carriers take their duties back as the current group gets tired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When carrying the body becomes too much to bear, we pass on the duties to someone else. And life is like that too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We keep carrying those we’ve lost physically in our hard drive heads. We immortalize through art and food and fragrance. And like the men who carry bodies to burial, we move on, we eat lunch, we read, we write, and in doing so, we share the burden of being alive with all that ever were.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Manage Self Not Other And Not Nature</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a saying my therapist gave me: manage self, not other (MSNO). The idea is that you can’t really control the actions and thoughts of others, so it is much more efficient to focus on your own needs and actions. And if all parties do this, the result is much more harmonious relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I run into these types of situations a lot. Situations where I have to choose pleasing other people over taking care of myself for instance. Or when I want someone to do something that will please me, and then I remind myself that doing that will only get me into more trouble, not to mention it won’t be very effective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Or when I want someone to do something that will please me, and then I remind myself that doing that will only get me into more trouble, not to mention it won’t be very effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also a piece of language I use when someone else trying to manage me. Even if the intent is to be kind, like a relative repeatedly asking if I’ve had enough food at a gathering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s a deeper valley to MSNO. I call it Mnaage Self Not Nature. And it might be a key to managing anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because anxiety has a lot to do with external events, things we can’t control. But if we manage self and not nature, then we effectively allow nature to run its course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the trick: nature will run its course anyway. So “manage self not nature” can be abbreviated to “manage self.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a much more empowering version of “stop trying to control things that you cannot.” That one leaves us feeling helpless. And it’s harder to stop doing something than it is to simply manage self.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Scaling A Productivity System</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m somewhat of a list ninja. I can create specific lists for any corner of my life and I have systems in place to execute on those lists properly. I’m always learning, but I’ve also &lt;em&gt;been&lt;/em&gt; learning for over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone on a subreddit asked about how to start with todo lists. It made me think back to my start with to do lists. Back in 2006, when I realized I just wasn’t organized enough naturally, I turned to the Getting Things Done book to try and get myself together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Someone on a subreddit asked about how to start with todo lists. It made me think back to my start with to do lists. Back in 2006, when I realized I just wasn’t organized enough naturally, I turned to the Getting Things Done book to try and get myself together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first to do list was a piece of paper. I had about 8 tasks. This was before I knew about &lt;em&gt;capture&lt;/em&gt;, or the art of noticing the opportunity for new tasks. It’s likely why I was so unproductive. I was conducting my life based on how I felt on the moment, not with any true intention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I got better at capturing tasks, the number of items I had to deal with suddenly ballooned. I gathered a bunch of multicolored index cards and a space pen that I lost and repurchased many times. I put a binder clip on the cards and put them in my pocket. There was a list for business ideas, songs, blog posts, and general todo items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My life at the time, though it didn’t seem like it, was pretty simple. I had coursework and a job, and eventually the task of getting a post college job. That was about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got my real job I had so many todos that my index cards weren’t really holding up. I had more tasks than ever, more categories of tasks than ever, so the system scaled: I started putting stickies on the perimeter of my cubicle, like how a cook takes orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as life got more intense, so did my system. In 2014, I discovered OmniFocus which allowed me to do things like hide tasks until a certain date, or only show one step of a project at a time, so I wouldn’t get overwhelmed and could break complex projects down. I was a teacher at the time, and became super reliable using OmniFocus. I was using OmniFocus by creating lists of location based contexts: I had a list for morning tasks at school, which was reserved for more cognitively demanding stuff like lesson planning. The afternoon list had more physical labor, like copying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then as I started to get into the phase of my life involving property and children, my tasks yet again ballooned, and so did my system. I started using the perspective feature in OmniFocus, slicing up my tasks multidimensionally, by project and by context. One filter or perspective I use shows me tasks related to any project that isn’t considered creative, and is due within 4 days and/or flagged as high priority. Another one shows me all creative ideas yet to be executed on. It’s another layer on top of context and project, a modular way of bringing up only tasks that can be executed on quickly and immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, a decade in, I like to think that I could handle any project that was thrown at me. Running a marathon, writing a book, stating a business, whatever. I went from 8 tasks on paper to hundreds of tasks with distillers and filters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it will occasionally require me to scale my system. Which means my systems must remain scalable. And it’s important to pick the right moment to scale. Too late and you’re drowning, too soon and your productivity vehicle is about as good as a boat in a bathtub.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Funneling Emotions With Skip Spaces</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We live in social media bubbles, as many have pointed out. Most of the people on my feeds seem to share the same political and social opinions. I wonder sometimes if that is actually due to social media itself, that our beliefs are shaped more than we ever realized by the low quality literature we read on Facebook and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be easy to do that, as a gigantic technology media company. It’s not just about the content or the audience, or the targeting of demographics. It’s about training.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;We live in social media bubbles, as many have pointed out. Most of the people on my feeds seem to share the same political and social opinions. I wonder sometimes if that is actually due to social media itself, that our beliefs are shaped more than we ever realized by the low quality literature we read on Facebook and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be easy to do that, as a gigantic technology media company. It’s not just about the content or the audience, or the targeting of demographics. It’s about training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media feeds have trained us to think that our day is never over. There’s an endless feed of updates that doesn’t close shop at 5pm, that runs on holidays, that doesn’t stop for weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it has also trained us to funnel our emotions. When we see a piece of content, we are presented with a very narrow range of emotions: sad, angry, happy, amused, confused, and enthused (which is what I assume the heart emoji means).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could of course ignore the content and do nothing, but as long as we do enough “reacting,” our brain is being trained to read a piece of content and react immediately, without much reflection. And even if we were to continue thinking it’s unlikely that we’d change our mind. We did, after all, make a choice when we clicked the emoji. And we’d hate to go back on our choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And! Even if we do nothing, there’s still a process happening in our brains to pick an emotion among those 5. Even if we never express it. That has to change our brain chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of accessing the palette of emotion when we naturally react to news, we instead land on a “skip space,” like on a board game. Maybe we landed on the skip space of anxious but our Facebook emotion funnel turned it into sadness. Those aren’t the same and we shouldn’t get into the habit of turning the hundreds of other emotions into skip spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, worse, when something does actually anger us, and we click on the anger reaction… in some way, that action alleviates the anger. The satisfaction of the act of expression may even be enough to forget about our anger entirely, which means that we end up turning real concerns and issues into skip spaces, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in a world of skip spaces, the actual range of spaces on which we can land becomes quite narrow. We land on something more primitive because the funnel forced us there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is simple but challenging: when you land on a “skip”… stay put.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Softie</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-04-04-softie/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, I’ve been trying to look at my sensitivity to all the stimuli in my life as a strength. I grew up with comments like “you’re too sensitive” and the &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; part of that sentence made me feel inadequate just for being who I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I’ve been thinking about better ways to describe this trait of mine to people when I meet them, especially those that I want to work with, or people to whom I’d like to provide value.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, I’ve been trying to look at my sensitivity to all the stimuli in my life as a strength. I grew up with comments like “you’re too sensitive” and the &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; part of that sentence made me feel inadequate just for being who I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I’ve been thinking about better ways to describe this trait of mine to people when I meet them, especially those that I want to work with, or people to whom I’d like to provide value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some words I got from the book The Highly Sensitive People is that I have a “finely tuned nervous system.” This is a pretty good description, I think, because it goes beyond just being sensitive to mean comments. It actually covers quite a bit of ground: I’m sensitive to lights, sounds, strong smells and other such things, which I’ve written about in the past. My reaction to this intense stimuli is not always negative, but it is always strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was describing myself in this manner to someone recently, they interrupted and said: “Oh, so you’re a softie.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I guess so,” I replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I started to wonder about what that means. What does it mean to be a “softie?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe it means that the core of me, my very soul, hasn’t hardened. That it’s easy to disrupt my general sense of well being because if I had a tougher or thicker coating around my heart and soul, I’d be more resilient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, what’s the opposite of a softie? A hardie, I guess? Someone who is completely shielded? Someone who is undeterred by any stimulus whether it’s a person’s words or whether it’s sensory?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But who is that exactly? Do I even know anyone like that? There are people that can give the impression that they are “hardies” but I don’t buy it. No one is undeterred in that way. There are people that pretend to care less, and there are even people who have lawn mowed their mental patterns enough where their habit is to disregard negative comments and negative situations, or even see the positive in those situations. Some people are more naturally suited for this than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to be dubbed a “softie” is quite a reductionist way to put it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be soft, like a cotton ball, means being absorbent. And absorption makes our lives richer and more fulfilling. It changes who we are, sometimes in a positive way and sometimes not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’d rather be absorbent than repellant. There’s likely a middle ground, but if you can get there, you’re probably in the minority.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Does It Mean To Be Bad At Change</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-04-03-what-does-it-mean-to-be-bad-at-change/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Right before my son was born, a friend of mine told me that I am “bad at change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn’t true. The friend might say that I am hiding from this fact, but I am a better judge of myself than he is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t believe I’m bad at change. I think I’ve been fearful of change in my life. I think new disruptions to my life throw me off my horse at times. But in order to process the fear, I’ve learned to hedge against change. To minimize its power by chalking it up to what it really is – a simple acceleration in the already bumpy ride that life is. And that acceleration can happen by a disruption, but it also seems to happen naturally as life speeds up. I can’t say for sure yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And that acceleration can happen by a disruption, but it also seems to happen naturally as life speeds up. I can’t say for sure yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve written before about how other parents “warned” me about how hard life would be when I have a child. About how it’s all doom and gloom, and I won’t understand until it happens to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I made a commitment before my child was born to do everything possible to be a present father and husband while also nurturing the parts of myself that feel the need to create (this blog became a daily occurrence around the time of his birth, for instance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so far, I believe I have succeeded. And by that I don’t mean that I do &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; for my family, because I can always do more. I can always grow more. I can always find ways to better support my wife, and my son. But I have succeeded in my goal of being present with my family, while still maintaining a spiritual connection to the muse. So far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I believe it’s a result of the mindset I adopted on the runway to parenting. Which is that many parents seem to set themselves up for failure. With Facebook posts to get their frustrations off their chests, or side comments about their kids that are meant to be humorous but end up creating beliefs and notions that are ultimately harmful to familial relationships. Like when I hear fathers refer to their children, especially their boys, as “psychopaths,” jokingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that doesn’t mean that there aren’t children that are hard to take care of, that there aren’t emotions that run wild in the pasture of the mind. It doesn’t mean that it is &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt;. It’s certainly not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by going into the job of parenting every day fearful that life as you know it is over will probably end up being a self-fulfilling prophecy. By embracing the change, the disruption, the fucking &lt;em&gt;joy&lt;/em&gt; of seeing a little person grow, we won’t avoid hardships or discomfort. Rather, we’ll step into the discomfort. We’ll wrap our arms around it, as if to say it’s good to see you again, I’ve missed you. The last time we talked, my heart grew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m not bad at change. No one is. But I also haven’t mastered it. And neither have you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if there’s one person that I can learn from when it comes to navigating change, it’s my child. He can’t do much yet. He can barely crawl, he’s just started eating solids, and we have to carry him most places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the intense period of time that is the first six months of life, he’s done beautifully, without even breaking a sweat. It’s about curiosity for him. The roadblocks aren’t anything he’s upset about at the moment (though I’ll hold my breath until he turns two, at which point I’ll need to be the role model for change, probably).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, he’s riding each wave as it comes. And there’s so much I can learn from that.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Preparing Tea</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-04-02-preparing-tea/</link>

&lt;p&gt;I always forget when I visit the UK how much of a love the Brits have for drinking tea. And surely, growing up, my mom who lived in Pakistan for her childhood was a very vehement tea drinker. Her cup would be filled with milky white tea every day, and she even had biscuits to go along with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My childhood experience watching people with coffee was a whole other thing. People who drank coffee seemed to do it carelessly, slinging the coffee cup around and letting it splash everywhere. I have the distinct memory of a cartoon where someone literally tossed the liquid from a coffee cup into the air and caught it in their mouth on the way out the door.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But tea?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents used to sit at the table, mid-afternoon, with their tea and biscuits. Usually a friend would be over as well. It was a social time, a “tea” time. Coffee seemed so rushed and so I associated it with higher energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After college, I went to a tea store that had just opened at the mall. I bought their most expensive green tea called Gyokuro, because I at the time I had a lot of disposable income. When I went home, I boiled water and threw the tea in for 3 mins before straining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this premium tea tasted like total shit. It was bitter as all hell, and I couldn’t figure out how anyone would love it. I figured maybe premium tea was inaccessible to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the internet helped me out. On the shop’s site, people commented on the tea’s product page. They mentioned that you actually have to use &lt;em&gt;warm but not boiling water&lt;/em&gt; to really bring out the flavors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used a thermometer to make sure I’d gotten it right. Sure enough, the resulting cup was a smooth, silky green that tasted a little bit like the ocean, but in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out I’d been making my green tea in the same way that most people make their coffee. With hot, scathing water to match their hot, scathing mornings. Waking up and bolting out of bed and scraping their faces or legs with razors and burning their tongue just to avoid falling asleep in their cubicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend Grant has a ritual with his tea. Preparing the tea takes more time than actually drinking it. In fact, the tea he makes is meant to be consumed in one sip, so he drinks it in a very tiny cup. He’s told me before that tea is a component of kinship. But I think the function of tea is much wider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gyokuro tea taught me that how you prepare food and drink affects not only the taste of the food or drink but also your mood. A warm cup of silky umami sets you up for success in a way that a scorching hot cup of black coffee never will.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>This Is How Death Works</title>

&lt;p&gt;In my family’s culture, the body is wrapped in a sheet and placed inside of a plain coffin. After a funeral ceremony, the body is transported in the coffin to the cemetery, but only by the men. We use a car to transport if the cemetery is far away from the funeral, but that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we’re carrying the body, the men huddle together and a core group hold up the coffin, which is heavy. We take turns, passing the coffin to new hands, while others take a break and walk alongside. Then those original carriers take their duties back as the current group gets tired.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I used to think of life and death as two sides of the same coin but maybe life is a bridge between two types of non-existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When carrying the body becomes too much to bear, we pass on the duties to someone else. And life is like that too. A few months before my son was born, my aunt passed away somewhat quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before my wife and I boarded a plane to get to her funeral, I addressed my son through the walls of the womb: &lt;em&gt;This is how it goes, Dez. Someone new comes along and someone else has to exit. There’s not enough space in the room and not enough room in space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may not be enough space for all the physical bodies, not as much space as we’d like. But on the hard drives that we’ve been carrying around since birth that sit in a stone case on top of our necks, there is somewhere between 10 and 100 terrabytes of storage space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We keep carrying those we’ve lost physically in our hard drive heads. We turn to books and writing when those hard drives start to fail. And like the men who carry bodies to burial, we move on, we eat lunch, we read, we write, and in doing so, we share the burden of being alive with all that ever were.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite moments in LOST happens during a flashback. Jin, one of the characters, is meeting with his father to tell him that he’s getting married. His father is a poor fisherman; Jin’s in-laws are rich business owners in Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their conversation, Jin relays all sorts of anxieties and troubles that he is having in his relationship. He starts to explain: “Father, in an ideal world…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And his father interrupts and says: “Jin, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an ideal world.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;There are many moments that I love in the series but this one really takes it. Maybe it’s that when we get more money, more success, and more power, we start to see the flaws. The little cracks in the surface that need fixing. We start to judge opportunity based on our estimations rather than our realities based on our perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a poor fisherman, Jin’s father accepts the world the way it is. He’s not mad at his circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could all stand to adopt this mental framework. If it’s truly an ideal world already, then there are so many opportunities just waiting to be seized. It’s only our dispute with this belief that holds us back.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Poems By Robots</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-03-30-poems-by-robots/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a site called BotPoet, which displays a poem that is either written by a human or a robot. You, as the spectator, get to vote on whether you think the poem is human-written or bot-written. After you vote, you get the true answer, along with a breakdown of what others on the site thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried this out myself. Turns out I can’t tell the difference very easily between bot-written poems and human-written poems. It’s almost like a Turing test. What does it mean that I, a lover of poetry, can’t tell the difference between an algorithm writing and a human mind?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I suppose it comes down to this: we make meaning from whatever we’re given, even if it’s random. This is a theme I explored the show I wrote and performed last summer (The Very Fabric of Reality). The idea of having a lucky number and seeing it in places, and assigning meaning to it, even though it’s likely that the number is just more apparent because of the importance placed on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a form of modular tenderness. Actually, it’s probably not – that’s a phrase that the internet randomly generated for me. But I bet when you read it, you connected it to the rest of the ideas in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s the magic and mystery of the human brain. It’s likely we do this all day long, in a variety of situations. We’re not quite robots, and robots are not quite human, but there’s an overlap in the randomness of the way we connect ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Did It Snow</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The night before a potential snowstorm was magical. No snow had actually touched the ground yet, and of course, our parents made us do &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; our homework even though the weather station was predicting a few inches in the morning because, hey, they could be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we’d go to sleep in the same way kids go to sleep on Christmas Eve. So excited you can’t sleep, but anxious because you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to sleep so you can just fast forward to the next morning and see what you got.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;And then when we wake up, for a moment we’re not sure what day it is. We get up like we always do and walk to the bathroom until we remember… ah! It may have snowed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at first, we listen. Are the parents up? Do we hear the sounds of the neighborhood waking up and starting cars outside, or do we hear the rough scratchy sound of a shovel against pavement? We look out the window and sure enough, there it is on the ground in blankets. And it’s still coming down. And there’s no way a bus can get through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it’s not necessary, we check the TV anyway and watch the list of counties scroll through until, there it is, our county is &lt;em&gt;closed&lt;/em&gt; for the day. The rest of the day can be whatever we want, but probably consists of a little shoveling and a lot of sledding. Maybe the neighborhood friends will come join us in the tundra, creating a lasting memory. Maybe we’ll hang out at someone’s house afterward and their parents will make us hot chocolate. And we’ll go to bed that night feeling full and happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if there isn’t snow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s the equivalent of waking up Christmas to no gifts. No gifts, AND you have to go to school. It’s the biggest let down in the world because expectations are a &lt;em&gt;bitch&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we’ll still have a collection of these days in our memories. Maybe 10, 20, or 30… of days that were supposed to be spent doing whatever it is we were going to do… but instead were spent unexpectedly remembering that pure joy is contagious. That play is essential. And that warmth and cold are siblings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that, just for a moment, even if by force… the entire city can shut down and relax together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve done it. I’ve bought myself five mason jars. I’ve loaded up on salad ingredients. And for the past half week or so, I have lunched on nothing but healthy and delicious salads. No breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t miss burgers or bagels or breakfast pastries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I do. Honestly, if I had my way I’d be eating a box of Duck Doughnuts every single morning with a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; cream filled coffee.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;And honestly, I know that I could probably eat healthily without having to eat salads for lunch every single day. Alas, while I’ve spent a lot of time in the past trying to make my diet less boring, I’m now thinking for the sake of convenience I’m going to make my diet, at least during lunch, &lt;em&gt;as boring as possible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean bland. Just, not very interesting. Salad with dressing. Vegetables, sometimes some whole grains. Things that my doctor tells me I should be eating more of. Stuff that would surprise no one. I made a salad excel sheet that turned into these charts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out that salad dressing, as a concept, is three parts oil to one part acid, mixed in with an emulsifier like mustard or mayo or pureed avocado. Looks like oil is half of the calories in the salad that I made. Vegetables don’t seem to have a ton of calories, and the protein like the chickpeas and quinoa have more but still a low number of calories to get to my goal of 6-700 calories. So extra virgin olive oil it is, for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinner, on the other hand, I’m going to try and make more intricate. More adventurous. Slightly higher calories. Something to finish up the day with a spark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, so good.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Problem With Teacher Auditions</title>

&lt;p&gt;When I was applying at schools as a teacher, there was a pretty standard application process. You’d send your resume and cover letter like always, and then you’d have an initial interview. If you made it past that stage, you’d move onto something that was called a “demo teach.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a demo teach, you teach a group of kids at the school at which you’re applying. Administrators watch you to see if your style matches what they are seeking and this is all considered when they make hiring decision in the end. Sometimes this can be substituted by a video of you teaching, but in most cases, you’re going in cold.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I went to one school on a Saturday. I was told that my goal was to create something fun, so I did an activity about first person and third person that involved drawing. It seemed fun, and the students seemed to understand my learning objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the demo, you are usually interviewed and asked to reflect on what you did well and what you didn’t do so well. After I gave my reflections, the assistant principal said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I thought that lesson was worthless. I would never ever want you to teach something so pointless to students. It was a waste of everyone’s time, including ours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I froze up. Had it really gone that poorly? I was told to make it fun, and I did. The entire room stood still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, all of a sudden, the administrator admitted to me that she had said that just to see how I’d react to harsh criticism, and that I could relax now. But I didn’t relax. I finished the interview but left feeling tense for about a week. She’d activated my fight or flight, my amygdala, and while it was a simulation, it felt just as real to me as being attacked by a wild animal. I figured there was no way I was going to get the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later, the school called me (it was someone other than the administrator who yelled at me) to offer me the job. I had already decided I wouldn’t accept it even if it was offered. When I told the administrator that I was not interested, they seemed shocked and asked why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told them that being yelled at in the interview, especially when I had followed the guidelines given to me, left me feeling really low, and that I couldn’t imagine feeling like that all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I started getting borderline defensive over the comments, and so the administrator then said: “Well, when you do a demo teach, we really are looking for your best teaching. Even though the criticism you got was exaggerated, it’s important to know that we will call you out when you feel like you aren’t doing your best teaching.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I responded by saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then I’m afraid you’ll be let down with every interview you do. Because a teacher’s best teaching can’t happen with a group of students that they don’t know. Teaching is an iterative process. You learn what to do and what not to do every time you teach a group of kids. You try to understand them as people as best you can, and by the end of the year, you have &lt;em&gt;some idea&lt;/em&gt; of what your best teaching looks like, but only for &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; group. And then the next year comes and you’re back to square one. Not with your skills, but with your relationships. I wish you luck.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a pause and then: “So, that’s a definite no?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their loss.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Water Bottle Stories</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One weird quirk about me that is that I’ve always been sort of opposed to drinking water over other beverages. The times in my life where I have developed a water habit have only happened for health reasons, not because I had suddenly developed a taste for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At restaurants, glasses of water always looked unappealing to me. Due to the transparent nature of the water, I could see all the dust, leftover grime, dishwasher streaks, and floaters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;At restaurants, glasses of water always looked unappealing to me. Due to the transparent nature of the water, I could see all the dust, leftover grime, dishwasher streaks, and floaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one year, someone gifted me a tall glass water bottle with an aqua blue silicone sleeve. It had a big white cap that twisted on and made a really satisfying but quiet noise when it had fully screwed on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I was a water addict for a while. I felt so cool, so futuristic, like I was drinking out of a capsule on a spaceship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first time I noticed other people’s water bottles. I worked in a school so I saw a variety of them. Big, small, wide mouth, tall, colorful, plain, textured, smooth…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me that with every sip, everyone with a water bottle was telling themselves a story. Water is so blank, so plain, that we dress it up with style using our own container. We do the same thing with coffee and smoothies sometimes but not as creatively as with water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still recall seeing a regular glass of water in the cup holder of my friend’s car, and it struck me as odd. I asked why he didn’t have a bottle to contain the water and he shrugged and said it didn’t really matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was right, of course – because that’s the story he was telling himself. That, for him, water doesn’t need clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no better reminds that we all see the world through our own eyes, and that storytelling is ingrained in most of our decisions whether we realize it or not.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my early 20’s, after I started a high paying (for a college student anyway) job as a consultant, my inclination was to finally buy all the gear that I had been salivating over for the past 4 years. Things like microphones, guitars (a large number of guitars) and cameras were purchased, and since I was living at home, there was no immediate financial consequence. I could continue living just fine with the rate that I was buying preamps, keyboards, and headphones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Things like microphones, guitars (a large number of guitars) and cameras were purchased, and since I was living at home, there was no immediate financial consequence. I could continue living just fine with the rate that I was buying preamps, keyboards, and headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t regret buying these items. Many of the things I bought have been sold over the years, on eBay or through services. My current studio and instrument setup has remained the same since 2012, and I use the tools regularly to create and share my art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first album, which gained me a few internet fans, was recorded using the nice stuff that I bought in my early 20’s. Some of the best photos I’ve ever taken were with my nice DSLR camera, and the internet video that went viral in 2012 was taken with a nice DSLR video camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also taken iPhone videos that have been shared and have changed minds and elevated emotion. I’ve also &lt;em&gt;watched&lt;/em&gt; iPhone videos that have had the same effect on me. Even the poor, grainy ones. I don’t think the Charlie Bit My Finger video that took the world by storm was taken on any fancy camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was all about the content, in the first place, all along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m convinced that had I shot my viral video on an iPhone instead of a Canon T2i, it would’ve been just as impactful. I recently recorded myself playing a song to my kid on my iPhone, which was shared and connected with many times. And that video is in low light and is quite grainy. It was the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the content, of course, came out of years of knowing when and where to pull out my camera and capture interesting moments. Without this skill, one that I’ve cultivated since being a young child, the nicest camera in the world wouldn’t be as effective as someone who knows what they’re doing with a flip phone and a 1 megapixel lens.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Changing My Brain Chemistry On Salads</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s something about exiting your 20’s and hitting your mid-30’s (like a bird against the window) that makes you really stop and think about your physical health. Throughout the years, I have made numerous attempts to lose weight and/or become healthier (because those are not always the same thing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some attempts had mixed results, like when I decided to jog every day for 30 minutes. I didn’t lose any weight in the process, but I did do cardio every day for a summer, and that was pretty useful. I also learned how to have discipline over a fitness regimen, something that I was severely lacking in my 20’s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I also learned how to have discipline over a fitness regimen, something that I was severely lacking in my 20’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did end up losing 22 pounds in the last year (and gained a little bit of it back when I went through the transition into parenthood), and I’ll outline how I did this in another post some time (because there was a ton of research that went into my approach). In a nutshell though, it all came down to how many calories I was eating. If I started tracking the amount of calories I ate per day, made sure that number put me in a caloric deficit for the day, did resistance training three times a week, and weighed myself every morning… the body fat started to go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you may notice in that equation I didn’t really mention “eating healthy foods.” I was focused on calories, which meant that I could still go to Burger King as long as I got a sandwich that was within the calorie limit for the day. While it was effective, I want to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are tons of diets out there that advocate for different ratios for different micronutrients, the one thing that most of them agree on is the importance of vegetables combined with a reduction in processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’ve always been against salads, due to my own bullshit reasoning that I’ve created in my mind. I’ve always thought that I won’t end up being full or satiated by salad. But my world view is based on the salads I’ve encountered at get togethers (which are sometimes good but often a side dish, so have never been something I’ve focused on directly as a main dish) and also at restaurants (hard to compare these to the burger and fries that are so incredibly addictive and delicious at every restaurant I go to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to deconstruct or dispute these beliefs, I think I have to start thinking that salads &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; potentially fill me up, since they contain calories like any other dish. And I also have to figure out how I’m going to make salads interesting, which is highly personal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a starting point. I’m attempting this week to only eat interesting salads for lunch after a failed attempt at making a rice dish last week. My hope is that my lunches will be easy to put together, and healthy. I’ll write another post about how it goes later on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Just you wait until you get married. Your life choices get narrower.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just you wait until you have a child. Your life is no longer about you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just you wait until you have two kids. It’s completely different than having one.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems like most of our time as a parent is spent either doing the “just wait” or the “right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do the right now when I’m giving my kid a bath; a lot of coordination is required to make sure he doesn’t hurt himself or drown.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I do the just wait when I see toddlers having meltdowns in public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think the key to staying afloat as a parent is making a 3:1 ratio for right now to just wait. Anticipation can be useful for planning and forward thinking, but only in infrequent small doses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Being In A New Place</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After college, it seemed like anything anyone wanted to do was travel the world. Most of the marketing messages we as young graduates were subjected to was about getting out of our comfort zone and seeing foreign places, experiencing foreign cultures, all the while gaining perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea didn’t appeal to me. I had yet to develop my fear of airplanes that I’ve now mostly overcome, so it wasn’t fear, exactly… but it was more that I didn’t understand why there was this pressure from society to go somewhere, anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The idea didn’t appeal to me. I had yet to develop my fear of airplanes that I’ve now mostly overcome, so it wasn’t fear, exactly… but it was more that I didn’t understand why there was this pressure from society to go somewhere, anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And years later, having been to more places than I ever expected to travel, I think I understand why the idea of travel appeals to people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there’s a level of discomfort that brings many people growth, and eventually joy. Second, breaking routine allows our brains to actually see things, to experience the new in such a way that it leaves a profound impact. Some of my best art was either made while I was on a trip, or directly after a trip. I have to believe such output is the result of new and stimulating input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the benefits of travel don’t come from the travel itself – they come from being in a new place. So it makes me wonder what being in a new place really means, and if we can replicate that feeling while we’re at home not traveling. I’m not arguing that travel is bad, but each person has their own tolerance for it. So these ideas are more about what we think are exclusive qualities of travel that may not be so exclusive after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of discomfort bringing out new realizations and sensations, and generally making us more aware can be achieved through planning. There are some people who do things like take cold showers, or athletes who run harder, longer and faster than they’ve ever run… all to get to the feeling of discomfort. Teachers do it in school, too. They try and get their students to be slightly uncomfortable because that’s where learning happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same goes for breaking routine. I might decide to take a different path to work, or maybe I’ll tackle a problem in a new way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick is that I have to make a conscious choice to become uncomfortable and/or break routine. With travel, this is forced and automatic, and therefore much easier to do (plus, the scenery is better, depending on where you go).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m old enough to remember the emoticon. The series of characters that you can type with a regular keyboard that look like facial expressions. Like this : ) or this ; )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sentiment is a funny thing. When we talk to each other in person, we are able to use facial cues, tiny micro movements, and other subtle body language to interpret meaning, feeling, and emotion. But now we communicate more and more online, so it’s important that we find ways to insert sentiment into our online conversations. Perhaps even as instinctively as we do with body language though perhaps more intentional.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Because if you’ve ever received an email from your boss that says &lt;em&gt;we need to talk tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;, you know that an emoji of some kind might ease the anxiety over the potential of being fired for something you were unaware of that you did to bother your boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in personal relationships, where much of what we build is built on digital interaction, we can use emojis to give each other hints into our actual disposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are tools that convey sentiment in a way that text cannot. In the same manner that facial cues can express sentiment in ways that words cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m willing to bet emojis and animated gifs have changed and saved lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applying to college in High School was an endless shame spiral. You’d take a hard look at your GPA, and then compare it to the average student that different colleges accepted. You’d make a list of reach schools, target schools, and backup schools. Then you’d apply to all of them and see what came back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I applied to American University early decision, partially because it was nearby and I was afraid of moving too far away from home, and also because it had an audio technology program (which is what I wanted to do with my life at that point in time). AU’s average GPA for accepted students was around the same as mine, maybe slightly higher… but I could’ve applied to a ton of different schools.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You’d make a list of reach schools, target schools, and backup schools. Then you’d apply to all of them and see what came back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I applied to American University early decision, partially because it was nearby and I was afraid of moving too far away from home, and also because it had an audio technology program (which is what I wanted to do with my life at that point in time). AU’s average GPA for accepted students was around the same as mine, maybe slightly higher… but I could’ve applied to a ton of different schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had somehow decided on a major at that point, which boggles my mind now. How can an 18 year old, someone who is barely an adult, have &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; idea of what they want to do with their lives? I heard about a college the other day that disallows freshman from selecting majors. You take general courses for a year or two, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; pick. Slightly better, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then when I graduated, I met a lot of people who went to “prestigious” universities. I felt slightly envious of those who went somewhere Ivy League, because it made me feel less worthy. Until I realized the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth, as occurred to me, was that no one &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; cares where I went to college. Sure, some brand names are impressive to people who care about that sort of thing, but ultimately I found that people were more impressed with my accomplishments, with what I could do with my skills, with the skills I had attained &lt;em&gt;since&lt;/em&gt; college. A masters degree may hold more weight; after all, if you have a master’s degree, it’s likely you’ve done some work in your chosen field. You have accomplishments, even if they are minor. But it’s still meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you haven’t accomplished anything since college, then it’s probably a good idea to have gone somewhere that sounds prestigious. It’s all you have to fall back on. Or, if you intend to work somewhere that judges people based on where they went to college, like a management consulting firm, then it’s also probably advantageous to have gone to prestigious school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most of the world doesn’t care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the rest of us, it’s business as usual: try to make a dent in our tiny corner of the universe, and gain credibility through our work products and not through the institutions that trained us.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Words Stick To My Teeth</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have an amazing long-term memory. My short term memory is total shit, but my long term memory amazes me on a daily basis (and many of my friends as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My memory’s so good that in ninth grade, I was at a movie theater and noticed that the guy who was selling tickets was a friend of mine that I sat next to all of second grade. He moved away from that school for third, so I hadn’t seen him since.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;I have an amazing long-term memory. My short term memory is total shit, but my long term memory amazes me on a daily basis (and many of my friends as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My memory’s so good that in ninth grade, I was at a movie theater and noticed that the guy who was selling tickets was a friend of mine that I sat next to all of second grade. He moved away from that school for third, so I hadn’t seen him since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sean?!” I shouted at him through the glass window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had no idea who I was. Even when I explained how he knew me, he told me there was no way he could remember that far back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words and sayings, I also remember. They stick to my teeth like steak. They have a profound effect on me, especially when they come from someone I admire. I hear people almost too well sometimes. I take what they say and let their words work their way into a locked box in my heart, for better or for worse. And as David Wilcox says, the trouble with keeping something locked away in your heart is that you still have to pay rent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize it might be a little unfair to the folks whose words stick with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently asked someone if they remember something they said to me years ago. A piece of advice that it really stuck with me. Doesn’t matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Man, I said that? I was an idiot,” they said. “You don’t have to believe that. I didn’t know what I was talking about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here I am, 20 years later, a small part of my personality and world view &lt;em&gt;founded&lt;/em&gt; upon the words you said 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ll never forget it,” is what I say to my friend. That’s what I say when words get stuck in my teeth like that. It’s the only way that sounds normal when I describe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just say stupid shit sometimes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to believe something is “stupid” if it resonates for more than a decade. But this is how we adopt thoughts without realizing it. It’s how we idolize our friends. It’s how we form a life, by adhering to the words of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it’s good to reminds ourselves that the people you respect &lt;em&gt;can actually be wrong&lt;/em&gt; and have &lt;em&gt;bad opinions&lt;/em&gt; that sound good on the surface but actually weren’t very thought through. How many conversations do you have on a regular basis where some of the things you say is totally throw-away conversation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of that garbage is another man’s treasure. He might remember one of your throw-aways for 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Songs Like Candy Songs Like Wine</title>

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the music I listen to is a lot like the food or drink I consume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was sitting in my living room with my Discovery Weekly playlist on Spotify, with the 5pm sunlight streaming through the window. I was playing with my son on our couch and he was being particularly smiley and giggly that day. And then, this song by Eric Whitacre came on. He had taken the words to the popular children’s book Goodnight, Moon and he had turned it into a gorgeous choral arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I was sitting in my living room with my Discovery Weekly playlist on Spotify, with the 5pm sunlight streaming through the window. I was playing with my son on our couch and he was being particularly smiley and giggly that day. And then, this song by Eric Whitacre came on. He had taken the words to the popular children’s book Goodnight, Moon and he had turned it into a gorgeous choral arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this particular moment, we were about to take Dezi to his daycare for a test run. We just wanted to leave him there for an hour or so in order for him to get acquainted with the house, and get familiar with its smells, sounds, and sights. And I guess there was a low-key anxiety about him starting daycare that was sitting somewhere in the back of my brain, and for whatever reason this moment (the sunlight, the giggly child, the intense choral arrangement of such a wonderful classic) brought me to tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just a couple of tears either. I would describe it as full on bawling. I don’t know if I’ve cried like that in a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I do what I always do when I hear a piece of music that moves me in some way: I added it to my monthly playlist. But if the song ever comes on in the car, you’d better believe that I switch it off. It’s one of the most gorgeous pieces I think I’ve ever heard, and yet I can’t consume it on a daily basis &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of how powerful it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are some songs, mostly the poppy quick ones with catchy choruses, that I pop like candy. I will play these songs up multiple times a day, and in some situations I’ll have the song on a loop for about 24-48 hours. I did this with Zedd &amp;amp; Maren Morris’ hit The Middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way that scotch on the rocks can be fulfilling but you can’t drink it every day, or how you end up eating all the chips at a party without realizing it, songs can be kept in a cellar until you need the emotion, and they can also be kept in a plastic container in your car like mints, ready to pop out when the impulse strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Play And Mindfulness With Children</title>

&lt;p&gt;Playing with babies is a great way to meditate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My son is a little over six months old and something that took me a while to understand about him is that &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; is new to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone can tell you that. But it’s weirder to see it in practice. &lt;em&gt;Everything is new.&lt;/em&gt; Sunlight is new, and it’s wondrous. The artwork on the wall at the coffee shop is a masterpiece. Even the way that the couch is shaped is astounding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;And me…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, everything used to be amazing. I even remember when I came home from college to the house I grew up in, and the neighborhood I played in as a child. It seemed different, sterile almost. But I know it was just as beautiful as I remember… I may not have been paying attention as closely as I did when I was a kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because that newness fades after a while, but not actually. It’s relative to the amount of time we’ve been alive. The sunlight is still just as beautiful, the moon is just as mysterious. We’ve just seen the sunset and moonrise so many times that it’s routine at this point. We don’t even notice anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when I’m playing with Dezi, he’ll pick up some object he’s never touched before. And he’ll marvel at it, and ponder about it, notice all of it’s intricacies, curves, angles, and textures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sometimes I’ll join in for this. We’ll examine, for instance, a teething ring together. And I’ll pretend like I’ve never seen anything like it before. And kind of like when you say a word over and over and it loses its meaning, this technique makes a known object become subtly foreign, and sometimes I &lt;em&gt;even notice new things&lt;/em&gt; about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be tiring to live this way, which is likely why babies sleep so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s a reminder that if we found beauty in it once, beauty can be found again.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Social Music Is Unnecessary</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When Spotify came out in the US, I was among the first people to use it. With a seemingly endless catalog, it was a dream come true for a music fan like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until Spotify, I’d gone through a record player, walkman, many discmen, a Creative Zen MP3 player, an iPod, and even an iPod Touch. For acquiring music, I went from records to tapes to CDs to Napster to Limewire to BearShare to Kazaa to AudioGalaxy and finally to invite-only Oink torrents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For acquiring music, I went from records to tapes to CDs to Napster to Limewire to BearShare to Kazaa to AudioGalaxy and finally to invite-only Oink torrents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the first few days of having Spotify on my phone worrying that the music would drain my battery, so I carried my iPod in my pocket as a backup. It took a few weeks to drop this habit. I now have a charging case for my phone. I also had an Amazon music account, which at the same was just a storage locker for MP3s. I used this for any stray MP3s that I couldn’t find on Spotify. I’m pretty sure those Mp3s are still sitting there in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the features that was interesting and new at first was that you could see what other people were listening to. It was really cool, actually. Instead of getting recommendations, I could just jump on to whatever my friend with good taste was listening to. And I thought it was kind of cool that people could see the stuff I was listening to, since I’m pretty good at finding new music that people like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after a while, I got self conscious. I realized that many of the songs I listened to were part of my spelunking process, in which I would listen to a bunch of unknown random songs hoping to find a gem. I wouldn’t want to subject anyone to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I realized that there wasn’t much value in seeing what other people were listening to. And that the act of sharing their stream might change what they put on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it did for me. Knowing that people were watching what I was listening to made me think twice before putting on something like Ariana Grande (what will people think?) or maybe people would think that I skip around too quickly, that I don’t spend enough time on one song…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The social feed, then, is simply a way to inspire judgment, positive and negative. And if there’s one experience that we probably shouldn’t ruin by introducing judgment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s listening to music.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Anti Debate</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From the moment we enter the debate arena, we are poised to disagree. We have counter-arguments ready, truth bombs to drop, people to convince and persuade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audience, in a thoughtful debate, will change their mind numerous times. But I’ve never seen a debate where a &lt;em&gt;debater’s&lt;/em&gt; mind is changed. Perhaps it’s by design and a debate is performance art. Like watching something static while everything else moves around it. Like values and beliefs ebbing and flowing around a stone in a river.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Perhaps it’s by design and a debate is performance art. Like watching something static while everything else moves around it. Like values and beliefs ebbing and flowing around a stone in a river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be nice, for once, to watch a debate where two or more people with different beliefs on a debate topic could only talk about assertions with which they genuinely agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This little constraint could turn a feud into a connection, hostility into discovery. We could call it an anti-debate. The participants would not provide false beliefs; they would just find common ground… and then they’d stay there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much could we learn from a conversation where we are forced to find our similarities and intentionally avoid talking about our differences?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no way to live, because we need to talk a about our differences sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for a brief moment in a very tense time, we could break down a barrier, and maybe see the humanity in those people we previously dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I woke up on March 1st, I rolled over in my bed and grabbed my phone off of my bedside table and immediately opened Facebook. After 15 minutes of browsing, my screen time reminder kicked in and told me that I was done for the day and that it was about to block the app… but that I had the option of keeping the app open if I wanted to, and ignoring the reminder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;When I woke up on March 1st, I rolled over in my bed and grabbed my phone off of my bedside table and immediately opened Facebook. After 15 minutes of browsing, my screen time reminder kicked in and told me that I was done for the day and that it was about to block the app… but that I had the option of keeping the app open if I wanted to, and ignoring the reminder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about asking my wife to set a screen time passcode that only she knew, so I wouldn’t be able to access the app as easily. Then I realized that even &lt;em&gt;having&lt;/em&gt; a thought like that meant my addiction had run a little too deep and it was time to take a break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the spirit of Cal Newport’s Digital Minimalism, I decided to go on a 30 day break from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram… the three apps that take up most of my browsing and phone time. This is Day 13. Here are my observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;intention&#34;&gt;Intention&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, giving up social media made the choices I make in my day much more intentional. Opening up any of the aforementioned apps is kind of like gambling, or spinning the wheel… you don’t know what you’re going to get, and sometimes what you get has value, but most of the time it does not. The schedule I make for myself for the day is much more certain; I know what I will accomplish by the end of the day, and every choice I make is rooted in what is important to me. Maybe I schedule time to be with my family, or maybe I spend time writing my book, or reading one… no matter what, I generally know what type of value I’ll get from the activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;high-quality-content&#34;&gt;High Quality Content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to note that most of the “literature” on these sites are extremely low quality, both as news sources and as pieces of text to be read. It’s the same with a lot of videos, the type that suck you down a rabbit hole. Most are low quality – they might make you laugh or maybe share with a friend, but they don’t provide any real value to your life. I went to the library a week ago for the first time in forever, and found an incredible book called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Pantheon-Graphic-Library-Richard-McGuire/dp/0375406506/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=here+graphic+novel&amp;qid=1552486837&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-2&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; that no algorithm would have ever served me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;no-algorithms&#34;&gt;No algorithms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, while I still have many algorithms in my online life (Amazon, YouTube), getting rid of the Facebook algorithm from messing with my brain has reduced anxiety quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-day-feels-complete&#34;&gt;The Day Feels Complete&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I described this feeling differently, in a slightly less specific way. I told people that the &lt;em&gt;flavor of life&lt;/em&gt; feels a little bit like life before I had social media. When I am in a waiting room for instance, the only thing I can do is sit and think and observe. It helps with creative flow. Otherwise, I’m just spinning the wheel on a social media algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now I can more specific. Last night, someone was complaining to me that it felt like there was never an end to their work. There was always something nagging them. Their to-do list, while finite, &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt; infinite. Like an endless feed of social media updates. Weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, in the last couple weeks, my days have felt complete. When I check the last thing off my list for the day, I either go to bed or I watch a movie or tv show that I keep on a Leisure activity list (yes, I keep a leisure activity list, and if you’ve never tried it, I highly recommend it… even if you think the idea is comical initially).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;social-media-has-trained-us-to-expect-infinite-updates&#34;&gt;Social Media Has Trained Us To Expect Infinite Updates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we’ve been trained by social media to expect never ending updates. Maybe those emails we get from our colleagues at 11pm at night are a result of social media training us to believe that there’s never an official close of business. Maybe the constant overwhelm we feel is due to the infinite nature of what we read and share online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe we can start thinking of ways to cull a finite list of resources and, as Cal Newport puts it, happily miss out on everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Favorite Parenting Moment So Far</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure I can really call what I do parenting. It’s more like infant servitude mixed with improvisational theater mixed with Pavlovian conditioning (for all of us).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experiences with Dezi exist in my mind like those string lights people put up at parties and holidays: each little multi-colored LED is a moment, and our time together is the wire in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing him smile at me for the first time was absolutely stunning. When he held his own bottle for the first time. When he ran toward me using a walker. But none of them compare to what happened yesterday in the bath.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Seeing him smile at me for the first time was absolutely stunning. When he held his own bottle for the first time. When he ran toward me using a walker. But none of them compare to what happened yesterday in the bath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My son laughs a lot, but it happens mostly when we’re tickling him, or singing something, or making a funny noise. And it happens alongside our cue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yesterday, he was sitting in his bathtub and I stopped what I was doing for a moment just to watch him. He took his hand and slapped the water, lightly. Without changing my expression, I reached in and splashed the water like he did. He stared at me for a moment and then hit the water again, except this time harder. So I responded by slapping the water with the same level of force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next splash covered my pajama pants in water. So I splashed back really hard, covering his entire head in water. Then we stared at each other, both dripping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he laughed in a way that I have never heard. Normally when he laughs it’s like he amused by something. Like you told him a good joke, or he saw the end of a magic trick, or he’s watching his favorite band. The giggle is slow and low. One “ha” at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was different though. It was high pitched, but not screechy, and his eyebrows went up, almost like he was shocked. It was as if he was so surprised that I splashed him that all he could do was laugh at how absurd the whole thing was. Obviously I was cracking up too. We continued to splash each other, his laughs getting more and more laughier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t say exactly why this is my favorite moment. Maybe it’s because, for the first time, I didn’t make my son laugh… we shared a funny moment. It’s the warm feeling you get in high school when your friends surprise kidnap you or when your long lost childhood friend flies home and knocks on your door without any warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of moments in parenting, like the string lighting I mentioned earlier. And every now and then one of those lights burns a little brighter and you have to put a mental bookmark on it to remind yourself to revisit later on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Good Music And The Other Kind</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a rule that I started following a few years ago: I don’t submit my music to songwriting contests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have anything against the contests themselves, or anyone who enters for them. I’ve just never loved the idea of a gatekeeper. The idea that someone, somewhere could determine the relevant value of my music to the world, and then for people to believe that my music does or doesn’t have value based on that one person (or committee) is especially hard to swallow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The idea that someone, somewhere could determine the relevant value of my music to the world, and then for people to believe that my music does or doesn’t have value based on that one person (or committee) is especially hard to swallow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know why we’re obsessed with being ranked, with having our music affect the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; amount people instead of the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; people. Well, maybe I do know why: it validates the work we put in, the hours we spend slaving away and obsessing over our music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But gatekeepers are dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago, I saw a post from a Facebook friend that I was barely real-life friends with. They were putting together a festival and booking a lot of local artists. Since the list of previous artists who had played this festival were all indie bands, and I’m a folk artist, I asked him: “What type of music are you looking for?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his response, citing Duke Ellington, he told me there are two kinds of music, good music and the other kind, and that this festival was looking for the good kind. So I sent my music in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s always amazed me that Duke Ellington, a real artist, would ever say anything so non-specific. And that a gatekeeper would then use that quote as criteria for entering their contest/festival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I looked up this quote. Turns out it actually says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are simply two kinds of music, good music and the other kind … the only yardstick by which the result should be judged is simply that of how it sounds. If it sounds good it’s successful; if it doesn’t it has failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know for sure, but I have to believe that Ellington meant that it doesn’t matter who made the music, or what style it is, or how musicals trained the players are… if it sounds good to you, it is good. And inherently, people will disagree about what’s good and not good. Success is a series of attempts. That’s all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was rejected from the festival, probably because it was more for indie bands than it was for acoustic artists. But I could’ve walked away from that situation thinking that my music was the other kind of music. The non-good kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now I know that if it didn’t sound good to that gatekeeper, then I didn’t succeed… but only with that gatekeeper. My music isn’t categorically not-good as a result. I didn’t fail everyone; I failed one person, and one that is furiously flipping through demos and making quick decisions too. Not someone that’s there to really enjoy the music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It pains me to think that anyone would take that person as an authority on the subject of music, at least in their capacity as a gatekeeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d rather listen to something has an audience of two (of which I am one) then a person who thinks they know the difference between good music and the other kind.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>If Youre Happy And You Know It</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;… clap your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, how do you know when you’re happy? And can you be happy without knowing it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose I was happy without knowing it for years. When I used to work a desk job (sitting at a cubicle all day), I felt like my life had no meaning or purpose. And it’s likely that the job I had was not in line with who I wanted to be at the time. I would’ve described myself as unhappy. I would tell people I had no passion for my job.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;… clap your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, how do you know when you’re happy? And can you be happy without knowing it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose I was happy without knowing it for years. When I used to work a desk job (sitting at a cubicle all day), I felt like my life had no meaning or purpose. And it’s likely that the job I had was not in line with who I wanted to be at the time. I would’ve described myself as unhappy. I would tell people I had no passion for my job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I left to become a teacher, I had &lt;em&gt;loads&lt;/em&gt; of passion for my job… but it was so mentally and physically draining that I wouldn’t have described myself as happy during that time. Maybe satisfied, but not happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now that I have a job that is flexible and just the right amount of work/life balance, I tell people I’m the happiest I’ve ever been. That could also have to do with having a child, because that is an act that increases happiness by leaps and bounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But was it really the job that made me happy? Or was it just the story I was telling myself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because as the song goes…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re happy and you know it, clap your hands…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child, I never refused to clap my hands when I’ve heard this song. I never took a mental inventory to assess my level of happiness. In fact, even if I was in a stormy mood, I’d still clap my hands because the song doesn’t make much sense otherwise. It’s a built-in participatory move. It’s almost impulsive, subconscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s the trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By clapping your hands without thinking about it, you’ve agreed to being happy. We clap our hands because we are happy and know it, but we are happy &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; we clap our hands. It’s the perfect feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s like how research shows that smiling automatically makes us happier. It’s not about the jobs we have or the events in our life, necessarily. Happiness is a mode. Clapping is one trigger, but there are many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness can be &lt;em&gt;turned on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Youll Thank Us Later</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Middle School is when everything your parents say makes no sense to you, when your friends become enemies and enemies become friends at the drop of a hat, and you have to start thinking, at least a little bit, about growing from a child to an adult. You also have to remember a locker code, or at least I did when I was a teenager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to spend some of these formative years in Cairo, Egypt. It was an interesting time, because I was going through puberty quicker and sooner than almost everyone else. I had full facial hair by age 13, which made me a freak show and a hero all at the same time. It’s awkward to live your pre-teen years looking and acting more like a teen teen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to spend some of these formative years in Cairo, Egypt. It was an interesting time, because I was going through puberty quicker and sooner than almost everyone else. I had full facial hair by age 13, which made me a freak show and a hero all at the same time. It’s awkward to live your pre-teen years looking and acting more like a teen teen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in Egypt, my parents rarely signed me up for anything against my will. Sure, when I was younger there was a slew of swimming lessons, and soccer practice, and piano, and summer camp. But in Middle School they laid off me a bit, and let me figure out what to do with my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one night they sat me down and told me they had arranged for horseback riding lessons every Sunday afternoon in Giza for about 4-5 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fought against this vehemently. One of the things that really irked me as a middle schooler was being forced to do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;, let alone something that would take up my precious Sunday evening which was usually reserved for listening to music and playing video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they made me. They said I’d thank them later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so our driver (it was common to have one living in Egypt as an expat) took my sister, me, and a couple friends to Giza, listening to a Third Eye Blind tape along the way. I grumbled the entire way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What business did my parents have in telling me what to do? And what did they know about what I’d like or wouldn’t like? I was nearly an adult now, after all. I know what I like. And it’s not riding on a horse on a Sunday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annoyed, I got on my horse and after a basic orientation, and we took off with a guide into the desert. It was 5pm or so, which meant that as we rode, the sun began to set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve never witnessed the sunset in the desert, the only word I can use to describe it is &lt;em&gt;spectacular&lt;/em&gt;. With a wide open area and no other structures than pyramids to block the sunset, it felt like riding toward a giant dripping ball of hot lava slowly cascading down below the horizon, leaving in its wake a picture-perfect purple, red, and black night sky. The Egypt sun was a sun that wanted you to know it was there. That left behind evidence of its majesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And me, in my 13 year old stubborn stupor, let that sunset slowly creep into my heart and make a home there. I wasn’t about to admit to &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; that I witnessed pure beauty, despite the fact that they were all there with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’ll thank us later,” my parents said. How long until later, I wondered? I already felt thankfulness expanding inside of me like what water does when it drips into a sponge. But when exactly would I be have the courage to tell them that they were right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the drive home, everyone was exhausted. We all fell asleep in the car, and the last thing I remember thinking, as my face smooshed against the car window, was how beautiful the stars looked from the backseat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my son was a newborn, he would occasionally get fussy. I learned a trick from a book called &lt;em&gt;Wonder Weeks&lt;/em&gt; that never fails to calm him down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hold him so he’s parallel to the ground, tummy down. I put him in front of me and fly him through the air like an airplane. We go around the entire house and I pretend to be the “captain” and occasionally make “announcements” about what he’s seeing from his “window.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;aaand we are passing mommy island, folks. Mommy island, established in 1985, is of course everyone’s favorite island in the world… now coming up on your right is mirror city… a perfect place for reflection…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wondered at first why this calmed him so much. I haven’t looked it up, but I do have my own theory: being able to see everything in front of you without a huge human face blocking things is kind of refreshing. And for a curious child like my Dez, it satisfies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most other times, so far in his life, he is either looking up at a ceiling or he’s looking directly into someone’s face. That’s changing now, as he learns to crawl and walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I want a calming airplane experience. To be able to see my environment without any blockers or barriers. Free from the influence of others. Free to enjoy the scenery and the ride. Free to observe and not interact with anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no one to pick me up physically, but I know who to go to for spiritual elevation if I ever need it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lets Talk To Our Children About Humans And Robots</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have four Alexa echos in my house. We use the echos to turn lights on when we’re holding babies, to arm our alarm system when we’re walking out the door, to keep timers while we’re working, and most recently we’ve set up our son’s room to turn off lights and turn on white noise/humidifier machines simultaneously with one command. I’ve also used Alexa to turn off my downstairs space heater after 30 minutes of use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;I have four Alexa echos in my house. We use the echos to turn lights on when we’re holding babies, to arm our alarm system when we’re walking out the door, to keep timers while we’re working, and most recently we’ve set up our son’s room to turn off lights and turn on white noise/humidifier machines simultaneously with one command. I’ve also used Alexa to turn off my downstairs space heater after 30 minutes of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren’t too polite to Alexa, which may need to change now that we have a child. A few people have pointed out to us that we often just give Alexa commands like “Turn on the alarm” or “turn on the den lights” without saying please or thank you. They think it will create bad habits in our children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying please to a robot seems unnecessary, and inefficient… at least in a home where no children are present. But what if it turns out that how we talk to our voice controlled robots may affects our children’s manners? I tried to find studies on this, but came up empty handed. I did, however, find the opinion of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fastcompany.com/40588020/the-case-against-teaching-kids-to-be-polite-to-alexa&#34;&gt;Fast Company&lt;/a&gt; writer which made me think:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By extending these human social norms to software and cloud services, are we teaching children that machines have sensibilities to be considered the same way we consider human feelings? Being polite to a piece of technology may suggest that AI assistants are capable of feeling appreciated or unappreciated; that machines have rights; and that one of these rights is the right to refuse our requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In teaching children to treat machines like people, we may also be treating people like machines. Telling kids to say “please” and “thank you” to software, knowing that no feelings are involved, could be construed to be telling them to to run their courtesy routines automatically regardless of meaning, effect, or purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t want my child to develop poor manners as a result of saying Alexa commands, and I also wouldn’t want them to start assigning emotions and feelings to a robot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My takeaway is that we all need to have “the talk” with our kids at some point about what it means to be human. This sort of talk used to be relegated to thought experiments that only the more philosophical parents would engage with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it’s a necessity. Today’s children are born into a world that is connected by technology; as such, they should understand its logical and emotional limits. The future will favor those who know how to “talk” to computers (via coding or other similar skills), but I now believe that the future will favor those who can understand what comprises a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That underneath Alexa’s silky voice, and Google’s doodle of the day, are the same elements we’ve always seen in computers: memory, storage, processing, and peripherals. And even machine learning is based on algorithms, which means that artificial intelligence is still just that, artificial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If children grow up knowing the true distinction between a robot and a human, perhaps they will be able to better optimize their robotic and Human Resources to meet their goals, build their businesses, and live their lives. And if not saying please and thank you to robots is our subconscious reminder of this distinction, then let’s teach our kids to be impolite to robots.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>When One Thing Leads To Another</title>

&lt;p&gt;One thing always leads to another. It’s what we teach children in 3rd grade with cause and effect. It’s what we teach adults through movies and TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a concept relevant to all industries. A doctor cares about one thing leading to another, and so does the economist. A parent cares about one thing leading to another and so does the bus driver.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minute we stop thinking about one thing leading to another, the more creative we get. It doesn’t take away the law of cause and effect of course, but it can lead to new avenues for understanding and for creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think the Beatles thought about one thing leading to another when they made their albums. I think they chose to suppress their understanding of cause and effect to make something original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, by ignoring the fact that they might change the world with their art, they ended up changing the world with their art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because when you think too deeply about consequences, it affects your choices. Sometimes that’s useful, like with breaking policies or the law. And other times, it’s limiting, like with sharing a piece of yourself through your art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick is to know when to ignore the fact of cause and effect. One thing always leads to another, but sometimes it’s better to think of cause and effect as magic rather than science. A mystery rather than a framework.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today’s my 34th birthday. I’ve discovered, especially in recent years, that my relationship with birthdays is complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my birthday as a kid, sometimes it felt like time stopped. It was a normal day for everyone else, but for me, it was a revelation. I’d notice details that I didn’t see on other days, and words people said to me meant more. There are certain stories and situations that are fairly mundane that I remember from birthdays when I was a kid.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Today’s my 34th birthday. I’ve discovered, especially in recent years, that my relationship with birthdays is complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my birthday as a kid, sometimes it felt like time stopped. It was a normal day for everyone else, but for me, it was a revelation. I’d notice details that I didn’t see on other days, and words people said to me meant more. There are certain stories and situations that are fairly mundane that I remember from birthdays when I was a kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birthdays always meant surprise. My mom is a classic surprise artist so there would be always be some treat that I wasn’t expecting and didn’t even knew I wanted waiting for me when I got home from school or wherever. Birthday parties were always unique and interesting: I remember we went to a real-life dollhouse once. Another time it was McDonald’s – believe it or not, they do birthdays there, or at least they used to. We’d take a tour of their kitchen. Superstar Studios allowed us to record music videos to a green screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then my first birthday as an adult, when I was a senior in high school, my parents wrote me a really heartfelt card and I cried. I remember thinking it was such a big transition, that I was now technically an adult. Little did I know it would take several more birthdays (about a decade or so of birthdays) for me to actually feel like an adult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was, of course, my epic 21st birthday that was strange, surreal, uncomfortable, and wholesome somehow, all at the same time. It’s a story for another post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I turned 30, I met up with some friends at a bar for margaritas (which is my birthday drink of choice). It was at an interesting point in my life where I had many different active friendships, and seeing them all in the same room was pretty incredible. What was more incredible was seeing wonderful friends meet other wonderful friends for the first time, falling in love with them the way I did initially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 31, I wanted to see as many people as possible, so my wife arranged four events over the course of one day. In the morning, my family (uncles, aunts, cousins and immediate) met at a diner. Some high school friends also joined for this. We then moved on to go ice skating with our friends who have kids. It was cold but fun. After that, we went to margaritas at a Mexican place (see age 30) with all of my teacher friends (and a few friends from college). Followed by hookah at a local hookah bar with my core group of high school friends. I remember that day I felt the most content I’d felt in a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was as fulfilling as ever – obviously, Margaritas were involved, but also amazing friends that I hadn’t seen in a long time. It feels amazing to have so many close relationships, but not in the context of popularity. It’s just that with every single friend I have, there’s a connection that is created over &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, whether that’s music or films or food or quirks. And to have so many unique and interesting connections to people is a true mitzvah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny, I set out to write a post about my complicated relationship with birthdays. About how I always feel melancholy, like I’m growing up too fast or like the last year went by in a flash. That it feels weird to assign meaning to the day I was born. And to be honest, many of my 34 birthdays have been like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But looking back over what I’ve written, it seems that the good ones have bubbled to the top. And perhaps that’s the magic of birthdays. They come and go, some contain moments of elevation and some are somewhat forgettable… but every year on March 4th, the air just &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; different for a day. And I am filled with a sense of wonder, for whatever reason. It’s inexplicable and I will probably break the spell by writing about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is that I am really bad with other people’s birthdays. I forget or I feel like I’m just joining the HBD chorus on Facebook. When I was a teacher, I was horrible about keeping track of my students’ birthdays, and now having written about the magic of birthdays as a child, I’m now drafting a unique system for myself to celebrate people on their day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we all deserve a celebration. We all deserve the best people in our lives in one room. We all deserve to watch them interact and mingle with each other, little extensions of our interests and passions finding new connections over drinks and cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if it is a somewhat superfluous cultural tradition, we all deserve birthdays.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Waste Of Milk</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was growing up, my mom was obsessed with making my sister and I drink milk. In fact, we bookended our day with milk. A cup in the morning, a full glass in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were told dairy industry lies, somehow convincing ourselves that milk would “do our body good” and would make us grow bigger and stronger somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that was characteristic about my childhood was stomach aches. It may have been childhood anxiety (I had quite a bit of it) or it may have been the copious amounts of milk I drank every day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that was characteristic about my childhood was stomach aches. It may have been childhood anxiety (I had quite a bit of it) or it may have been the copious amounts of milk I drank every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a little break from the milk in middle school when my family lived overseas in Egypt. I felt better then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we moved back for high school, things were different. Gone were the days of eating together at the table with a glass of milk pre-poured and waiting for me next to my pop-tart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rarely even ate breakfast in high school. Instead, I’d wake up and barely have time for a shower before I was out the door. I usually didn’t even eat my first bite until the predetermined snack time in high school, about 10:30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my mom would leave that glass of milk on the bathroom counter. She wanted me to drink it after my shower. But drinking the milk made my stomach hurt and I had finally made the connection. So unbeknownst to her, every single day… I poured that glass of milk directly down the bathroom sink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve done the math. If there were 8 oz in the glass every day, and 180 school days in a year, and 4 years of high school… then I poured about _45 gallons_of milk down the drain over the course of high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing how much milk I wasted. And how that milk would’ve been wasted if I had consumed it anyway. A waste of something that is already kind of a waste itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story is a clear illustration of the reasons to re-examine our behavior, our patterns, our beliefs. We all believed drinking milk would reap huge benefits, but it turns out it was just making many of us sick every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve since expanded our knowledge, but I guarantee there’s a habit in your life that you believe in with the same conviction that my mother had in the power of milk.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>To Be Smart</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The other day I was conducting a training on a topic I had spent a lot of time learning and understanding. This was a speech I could do with my eyes closed, in my sleep, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point one a trainee interrupted with: “Wow, you are &lt;em&gt;so smart!&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the compliment and chuckled, but my laughter came somewhat out of confusion. I had impressed this person with the knowledge I’d accumulated about a particular piece of software and she equated that to mean I’m “smart.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;The other day I was conducting a training on a topic I had spent a lot of time learning and understanding. This was a speech I could do with my eyes closed, in my sleep, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point one a trainee interrupted with: “Wow, you are &lt;em&gt;so smart!&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the compliment and chuckled, but my laughter came somewhat out of confusion. I had impressed this person with the knowledge I’d accumulated about a particular piece of software and she equated that to mean I’m “smart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often hear young children recite facts and we say &lt;em&gt;ah, they are super smart!&lt;/em&gt; And there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; skill required to memorize facts… but is that the same as being “smart?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Smart” is one of those words we use a lot but probably couldn’t define usefully if randomly asked. The dictionary says “having or showing quick-witted intelligence” and in the case of machines, “programmed to be capable of some independent action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s likely if I asked you what it means to be smart, you wouldn’t run to the dictionary. You’d instead espouse your own philosophy of what it truly means to be intelligent. “Smart” is a word to which we attach emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask any elementary school teacher to define the word smart, and each one will give you a slightly different answer, if not a wildly different answer. Mine, as a third grade teacher, was that “smart” is not a quality that one has; it’s an ever-changing state of mind. To be smart is to have well-defined values and to make choices that adhere to those values, as consistently as possible. &lt;em&gt;Smart is a choice,&lt;/em&gt; I would tell my students. &lt;em&gt;Less of an adjective and more of a verb.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve all had our intelligence insulted before, but most of the time it’s not that the person insulting us really thinks we’re not smart, it’s that our values don’t match theirs. To believe non-factual statements as truths doesn’t mean that we aren’t smart, because it’s likely that &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; has baseless beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when we gossip with our co-workers about the new hire, when our values are to be kind and accepting… maybe that’s not being smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the first time we stand up for a victim of bullying because our values are to look out for the wellbeing of others… maybe that’s smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s liberating, isn’t it? Being smart isn’t about the number of books you read, or the amount of podcasts you listen to. It’s not about how many words you know or how eloquently you can speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s about the topics you speak about, eloquently or not. It’s about how you use the information you get from books and podcasts. It’s about how you use the words you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know to make change where we need change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person in my training who called me smart was being nice, of course. They wanted to thank me for my helpfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But knowing information isn’t the same thing as being smart. And that’s a belief I will defend as long as I’m alive.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Social Media Fast Begins Today</title>

&lt;p&gt;After reading Cal Newport’s Digital Minimalism, I’ve decided to give a social media detox a try. So as of today for the rest of March, I’ll be off Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram (other than my work accounts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m keeping Reddit, RSS, and YouTube because they don’t have that addictive quality for me. At least for now. YouTube is a major timesuck but I basically use it as my TV provider so I consider it necessary. But I’ll be blocking it during most of the day using the Freedom app. I may even experiment with giving up Spotify but the alternatives are more expensive or slightly limited.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The idea is that without access to these accounts for a full 30 days, I’ll be able to return to them in a meaningful way in April. And the other nice thing about that is it will be &lt;em&gt;April&lt;/em&gt; and the weather will be much nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will still continue writing and will post a new piece every day automatically to Twitter, I just won’t be able to see it happen, or respond to any replies (which never really happens anyway).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve experimented a bit in February with limiting access to social. Using the Freedom app to block Facebook was successful but I still found myself mindlessly surfing during non-work times. As much I wanted to avoid a full on detox, it appears that’s what’s necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that social media is as bad for us as sugar or nicotine, but that there is one thing that can change the addiction: intention. Every time we log in without an intention of what we want to do (look at our family’s baby pics, collect news stories, etc.) we are essentially gambling. We are pulling the slot machine to see what comes up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s rarely cherries. You know it. I know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social is a bit like the house in a gambling scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the house always wins.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Emailing Terry Pratchett</title>

&lt;p&gt;Do you remember your first experience with the internet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was 9 or 10 (1994), my elementary school got a dial-up internet connection and the modem could connect to &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; computer only. So classes would go into the computer lab and huddle around one computer monitor trying to watch the magic happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My teacher explained that we may or not be able to connect to the internet, because the modem had been spotty during other classes. But if we connected, she said, we’d be connected to other people’s computers across the entire world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The idea of the computer, a device I’ve used since I was 3, talking to other computers &lt;em&gt;quickly&lt;/em&gt; and in remote parts of the world was exhilarating to me. These days, I take it for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device didn’t connect that day and we couldn’t figure out why. But when I went home, I convinced my dad to get us America Online since they were offering free trials of 50 hours on CD-ROMs at the local Barnes &amp;amp; Nobles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the first thing I did on my AOL account, named RAZA after all the first names in my family, was try to email famous people. And on every email to every famous person I contacted, I only wrote on one line. I asked them all the same question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you the real [insert celebrity]?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I emailed this to Mariah Carey, who wrote me back. I asked her to prove her identity by telling me what her name meant. She responded to say she wasn’t totally sure, and then asked me not to send hate mail if I find out she’s not the real Mariah Carey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found her by searching Mariah Carey on AOL’s directory. Yes, I was young, but so was the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this way, I also emailed (people who I presumed were) John Popper from Blues Traveler, Michael Jackson, Paula Abdul, and one of my favorite novelists, Terry Pratchett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not familiar with Terry Pratchett, go and read any of his Discworld novels. They are all hilarious. It’s hard to get fantasy right, and it’s hard to get comedy writing right, therefore it &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; hard to do both… and Terry Pratchett is masterful at combining the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His novels and his video game Discworld are weird, funny, obscure, and played a lot with the idea of time and reality. At one point in the game, for instance, the main character (a red robed wizard) is hanging upside down from a flagpole. The Grim Reaper appears and has a conversation with the wizard. The wizard tells Death that he doesn’t want to die; Death starts listing off the positive aspects to death, like “Have you ever thought about the savings on rent and clothing?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pratchett died of Alzheimer’s in 2015. And whoever I emailed on AOL’s directory named Terry Pratchett wrote me back. In fact, other than Mariah, he was the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; one that wrote me back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you the real Terry Pratchett?” I had written in my initial attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The return email came back about 4 days later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Depends on what you consider real ;)”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yup. It was him. In six words, he had taught me a lesson and given me a a personal moment to remember forever. Thanks, and RIP, Sir Pratchett.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Explaining The Inexplicable</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before Dezi was born, I asked every parent I came into contact with the same question: what is one thing you wish you were told about parenting? And what’s one thing you were told over and over again but didn’t end up being true for you? I figured the responses to these questions would change my brain chemistry a bit, and maybe make me slightly more prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The responses were interesting. Most notably, some parents said they wish they were told how much love they’d feel for their child upon their arrival… about how post-birth, some part of them unlocks, and they suddenly “get it.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Before Dezi was born, I asked every parent I came into contact with the same question: what is one thing you wish you were told about parenting? And what’s one thing you were told over and over again but didn’t end up being true for you? I figured the responses to these questions would change my brain chemistry a bit, and maybe make me slightly more prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The responses were interesting. Most notably, some parents said they wish they were told how much love they’d feel for their child upon their arrival… about how post-birth, some part of them unlocks, and they suddenly “get it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some parents told me that they were told they’d feel intense amounts of love, but instead mostly felt a sense of duty and responsibility at first. And anxiety. The love grew as the child did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wondered into which camp I would fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when he arrived… at first I was just bewildered. Here was this tiny exhausted little creature, with hair patterns on his shoulder and back that looked like mine. He slept on Liza, and then on me, and then the doctors put him on the warming table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for the first time I got to see his curious face, his eyes darting around the room, his legs kicking around like some horizontal break dance. I remember that I told him that I’m his dad, and also informed him that I’m just making this parenting thing up moment by moment. I heard his coos, which started on Day 1 and are still going strong six months later. And then he looked up at me for the first time, squinting through his puffy little eyelids, and I felt my heart trying to escape my chest. That settles it, I figured. I was firmly in the intense love camp. Anxiety, responsibility and duty were in there somewhere too, but I was overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was something I didn’t realize at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As time went on, and I got to know him, it didn’t feel like I was meeting a new person. It felt like I was meeting an old friend or family member, someone I’d known my entire life, or maybe someone I’d known even before life itself. I looked at his newborn face and just knew who he was somehow, felt his jovial energy, his gentle presence, his wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even more strange was that he appeared like some undulating fourth dimensional creature, transcending time itself. At any moment, I could look at him and see him as as a 3 year old, a 20 year old, and an 80 year old all in one glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And every day, it felt like I was stepping deeper into a pool that was potentially infinite. That love I felt when he looked at me on the warming table, that warm feeling I thought I understood… that was tiny. A seed. Every day it intensifies, grows, strengthens. I wouldn’t describe it as love increasing every day. it’s not like a balloon that keeps expanding. Not like seeing the entire coastline from the shore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it’s more like stargazing and having no concept of how far away the moon or the stars or the planets are, but just feeling comforted that they’re there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those parents who so sweetly answered my question about what to expect, they were actually all attempting to convey the same emotion. It’s just that it’s so hard to explain something so inexplicable. Words like love, responsibility, joy, anxiety, and fear… lack the specificity needed to even come close to describing how it feels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my life right now: It’s like when Alice finds the rabbit hole, or when TS Eliot builds in a poetic turn, or when Jack finds Desmond in the hatch. Your entire perspective shifts and you realize you’ve been skating dopily on the ice above a mysterious and stunning universe down below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is just the first six months. I’m holding on tight, I promise.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Religion A Stew Of Wonder</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first experience with religion happened when I was a child. I was told, right out of the gate, that I was Muslim. I attended a jamaat with my parents each Friday night, and celebrated Eid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My family also celebrated Christmas. It was probably because they wanted to make sure my sister and I didn’t miss out on any American fun as children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I was: an American Muslim kid with immigrant parents, experiencing the drudgery of going to a weekly religious service with none of the fun stuff, and experiencing all the fun stuff of a different religion without the drudgery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So here I was: an American Muslim kid with immigrant parents, experiencing the drudgery of going to a weekly religious service with none of the fun stuff, and experiencing all the fun stuff of a different religion without the drudgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In middle school, I lived in Egypt which made me proud to be Muslim. The kids there were cool, hip even. It was normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year after I moved back to the states, 9/11 happened and I was thrown against the cold bathroom wall by a classmate accusing “my people” for being responsible for this terrorist attack. It’d possible he was joking, playfully fighting as high schoolers will do… but all I remember was his hands holding my wrists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went through an intense period of atheism after that. I figured it didn’t make sense to follow rigid religions. I was free to make my own choices. I didn’t believe in God, and I didn’t pray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it wasn’t fulfilling. It also didn’t help my relationships with non-atheists, with whom I would argue when the topic came up. I’d use what I called “logic” to dismantle their beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my 30’s, I started to realize that these folks, most of them, were simply trying to live their lives, and that their religious beliefs were tools that helped them do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I realized that I had my own tools. I was religious too, but I didn’t have a religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My list of tools included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zazen meditation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;good foof&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fireflies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;songwriting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;recording&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lifting weights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;time and energy tracking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These daily routines enrich my life, gave me the ability to figure out my meaning and purpose. They still do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t pray, but praying isn’t a requirement of religion. Neither is believing in a deity. I now say “I don’t know” with confidence but it is fun to process the fact that there are secrets in the universe that cannot be known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all boils in a stew of wonder. That’s nourishment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Dancing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, I was a great dancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned moves from watching Michael Jackson and Madonna videos. I just loved the free feeling I felt while I was dancing. In fact, I was &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; spirited with my dance moves that family members would often ask me to dance to music at parties when I was a kid, just so they could watch me fling my body around with glee and attempt to moonwalk. I was a good dancer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, I was a great dancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned moves from watching Michael Jackson and Madonna videos. I just loved the free feeling I felt while I was dancing. In fact, I was &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; spirited with my dance moves that family members would often ask me to dance to music at parties when I was a kid, just so they could watch me fling my body around with glee and attempt to moonwalk. I was a good dancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I danced like I was from another planet. Though it was Michael Jackson inspired, there wasn’t any particular style to it. It wasn’t jazz, or tap, or ballroom. I didn’t know what those things were. I didn’t even think about it. Dancing came as naturally as breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a club once in Montreal at age 7, I hit the dance floor at a restaurant where I was eating with my family. I must’ve been pretty enthused, because two female Canadian college students asked me if I’d dance with them. I was a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; dancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I got older, dance was a huge part of my life, but not in the official sense. I did an aerobics type dance class after school when I was 10 or so, but never really enrolled in any kind of dance lessons. Though I may have been the only boy in the class, I looked forward to it every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high school, I became interested in singing and auditioned for a musical. I was expected to learn choreography and execute it properly for the first time. It wasn’t the body flinging experience I’d had when I was younger. For the first time in my life, I was a bad dancer. My moves as a child were just born of pure joy, but they weren’t dancing. This was &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; dance. And I was atrocious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It got worse when I tried to audition for a local musical theater troupe. The reason for their denial was understandable: my singing was fine, they told me, but I needed more dance lessons. I was, again, a bad dancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in college, my passion for dance extinguished at this point, I was made fun of various times when I’d dance in public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hated to dance, at least in public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped dancing at weddings, at parties, and at concerts. I damn near refused to do the Hora sometimes. It didn’t bother me that I’d stopped dancing in public because my original passion for dancing was strictly to entertain myself. It was simply a way to express joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s the thing about stealing joy. None of the people who discouraged me from dancing ever meant to steal joy, but it happened anyway. Drip by drip until there was nothing left. How much joy have we stolen from each other just because the manifestation of that joy didn’t conform to the standard?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve since recovered a bit. I’ll occasionally dance if the spirit moves me, or if I’m intoxicated, or if I’m in the presence of people I love and trust. Whenever I do it, I take a big breath and figure that’s probably better to let the spirit bring me into a state of dance than it is to keep the rhythm locked away in some kind of safe in my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Warm Hug</title>

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to my riff about no-hand-holding, I had another experience as a new employee that I’ll remember forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their book The Power of Moments by Chip and Dan Heath, the authors discuss all the elements that go into creating a life-defining, memorable moment. When you read through this book, it’s easy to see how one can create such moments in every day life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to my riff about no-hand-holding, I had another experience as a new employee that I’ll remember forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their book The Power of Moments by Chip and Dan Heath, the authors discuss all the elements that go into creating a life-defining, memorable moment. When you read through this book, it’s easy to see how one can create such moments in every day life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these kinds of moments occurred when I started my most recent job. I was hired as a contractor, so my co-worker group felt kind of splintered. On top of that, we were in many different places across the country, working for different companies and in different capacities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the people that I work with called me in for an orientation meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I figured you could use a compass to get oriented,” she said, as she made diagrams on napkin paper in the eating area of an office where we’d met up. “Consider this meeting a big warm hug.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how old we are, and no matter how much experience we have in an industry, a &lt;em&gt;big warm hug&lt;/em&gt; is the perfect way to start a new job. As Chip &amp;amp; Dan Heath point out in the Power of Moments, the first day of work is a &lt;em&gt;remarkable&lt;/em&gt; time of transition and excitement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new employee transitions into new responsibilities, new social structures, and new daily routines. And yet the first thing we do when we arrive at our new job is that we take a tour of the office, bothering everyone trying to do their work, only to forget their names later. Then, we sit at our computer for most of the day checking email (with nothing really coming in).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How amazing would it be for all new employees to get a figurative big warm hug on the first day? It could look different depending on the work, and the person. Despite the fact that you’ve been accepted into a new position, it doesn’t mean that you’ve been invited yet to join the culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what we could offer on a new employee’s first day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>No Hand Holding</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-02-22-no-hand-holding/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During my senior year of college, I attended a number of job interviews on campus. At one of them, I was interviewed by three separate people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first person asked most of the questions I had been prepared for. We talked “a little about me” and went over my accomplishments, strengths, and weaknesses. I robotically told her that I am a quick learner, but also gave some examples to back it up. I’m not sure how true it was.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I robotically told her that I am a quick learner, but also gave some examples to back it up. I’m not sure how true it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second interviewer asked me about my willingness to comply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If I said, be in Texas by 9am on Monday, would you be able to do it?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Absolutely!” I said. I hadn’t really thought that one through. But I didn’t want to seem hesitant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third interviewer didn’t have any questions for me at all; instead, he asked me to ask him questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would later learn that having questions prepared for an interview is arguably more important than giving good answers. I hadn’t prepared anything, so I went with “what’s the culture at your company like?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He thought a moment and then said: “Well, there’s no hand-holding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 years later, this comment still sticks with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it does mean to refuse to hold someone’s hand? Holding a child’s hand helps to them to keep moving, helps them to keep from falling. But what happens when an employee at this company falls, since they inevitably will in their first few days/weeks/months/years at a new job?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do they offer a hand to get back up off the ground?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now know that what they will do is come after me with metrics and numbers and goals. I know that they’ll expect a lot from me. And I would never expect anyone to coddle me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it takes a while to learn a new skill. It takes time to adjust to the demands of a demanding job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you’re not willing to hand-hold, at least at first, then who will take responsibility if and when I fall flat on my face?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To join a company or an organization is to become part of a team. And if a team’s culture is every person for themselves, and if you fall over we will intentionally avoid helping you get back up…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then that’s no team at all.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bite Sized Pieces Of Life</title>

&lt;p&gt;How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you turn an elephant into bite sized pieces? Cut it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you cut it up? Use a tool. A pair of scissors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s natural. We do it with our teeth when we eat because even bite-sized food still requires multiple bites, incisions, and chews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s how we cook, cutting the food up to more efficiently brown the vegetables. Increasing the surface area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;And we do it with information too. Bulleted lists, Twitter threads, paragraphs, Instagram stories. Bite sized information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with our relationships. We take it moment by moment. We say &lt;em&gt;it’s going to be okay&lt;/em&gt; because this sadness is just one bite, and we just sat down at the dinner table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An elephant is easier to eat when it’s one bite at a time, but a bite of tusk differs from a bite of cheek.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Fundamental Truth On Christmas Morning</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-02-19-a-fundamental-truth-on-christmas-morning/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I learned a fundamental truth about myself around Christmas in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the year that I convinced my dad to let me get a PlayStation for Christmas. The video game console had been out for a while, so I was late to the party. But it was fine because the most up-to-date system I owned was a Super Nintendo, which was outdated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It worked. He agreed. We went to the video game store the weekend before Christmas and he bought me the PlayStation, along with a couple of games.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It worked. He agreed. We went to the video game store the weekend before Christmas and he bought me the PlayStation, along with a couple of games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we came back home, I was excited to try the new console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t you want to wait until Christmas morning?” he asked me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No,” I replied. “Too excited. Plus I’ll be busy with my other presents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad got serious and a little worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There aren’t other presents for you on Christmas morning,” he said, carefully. “The PlayStation is it. It’s the monetary equivalent of your usual set of gifts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, my parents had gotten me ten or so random but inexpensive gifts. They’d be scattered around the tree in the morning, some labeled “from mom and dad” and some labeled “from Santa.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes they fulfilled requests, but never anything nearly as expensive as a PlayStation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cried and cried. Christmas was my favorite holiday and there was an intense enjoy in ripping open my presents. My parents were good at balance; some gifts would be things I indicated wanting and some were gifts my parents rightfully assumed I would like but that I hadn’t considered myself. And really, aren’t those the greatest presents?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’ve got a choice,” my dad told me. “I can return the PlayStation and get you your regular gifts, or you can keep the PlayStation but that’s all you get.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about it hard that night. And the next day at school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thought of Christmas morning without ripping open gifts was sad, but also, I had done the impossible and convinced my dad to buy me a PlayStation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked my friends what they would do. All of them said they’d take the PlayStation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who cares about one Christmas morning traditions?” a friend of mine shouted. “It’s a &lt;em&gt;PlayStation!&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rational thought. But I wasn’t rational. I was romantic and sentimental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told my dad to return the PlayStation and that I wanted a normal Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, on Christmas, the tree was filled with inexpensive but thoughtful gifts. Every time I opened a bigger one, I half expected to see a PlayStation. I fantasized that my dad was bluffing, that it was too annoying at this point to take back. That he’d cave and let me have my cake and eat it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He didn’t. And there was a part of my 11 year old heart that felt wistful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I learned something important that Christmas. Which is that I valued tradition and familiarity on one special day more than having a PlayStation all year long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned that I am not rational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned that irrationality is a function of sentimentality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned that my happiness is not always congruent with other people’s happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I learned to be okay with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my first day of kindergarten, I remember mindlessly singing Under the Sea from the little mermaid and getting destroyed by my table mates about it. I cried, the teacher intervened, and eventually those boys became my best friends growing up. But a feature of our relationship was them teasing me incessantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as I grew up, it kept happening. My cousins, slightly older than me, made fun of me to the point at which I’d dread them coming to visit and would also at once be excited. My friends in 7th grade made fun of my lack of athletic ability, though this was also the year I really discovered singing, which counteracted the depression over a lack of sportsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

My friends in 7th grade made fun of my lack of athletic ability, though this was also the year I really discovered singing, which counteracted the depression over a lack of sportsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is what kids do,” my mom told me. “You have to have a thick skin. Act like you don’t care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I did care. I was wrapped up in what people thought of me, how they perceived me, but most importantly, the messaging I got from adults in my life was that the burden was on &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. That it was normal behavior to be ridiculed or ribbed, and I just had to accept it or accept having no friends instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s how boys communicate,” a teacher once told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then I’m not a boy,” I told her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We make fun of each other,” friends would say. “It’s not just you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sure, I’d watch them rib each other. But it wasn’t the same with me, I didn’t rib anyone back. There was an imbalance in our communication. It just wasn’t my style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried it once. Spent a year or two intentionally making fun of others to see if somehow my new behavior would allow me to finally fit in to relationships that I’d felt had always left me out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t work. Or I didn’t do it right. It came off as inauthentic. Because it was. So I stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on it went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just giving you a hard time,” a friend told me when I got upset at a particular comment he made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But as my friend, wouldn’t you want to be giving me an easier time? It’s hard enough as it is with the people &lt;em&gt;I don’t&lt;/em&gt; know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve realized a couple things over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s perfectly okay to let go of friends who tease if I’m not into that. They may not have malicious intentions, but that’s irrelevant – it’s an aggressive communication style and it just doesn’t work with my communication style. For all the good times we have, it isn’t worth the constant feeling of vulnerability. The weight of the imbalance is too taxing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, it isn’t necessary. I have plenty of friends who don’t do it, that I love being with. These are people who like who I am, and when I’m around them, I can truly be myself. And to be clear, some of these folks do “rib” me on occasion and vice versa. But it’s rooted in an otherwise trusting and mutually loving friendship, so it feels less like I’m a joke and more like we are joking together about our quirks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s those who choose to be vulnerable around me that get the privilege of pointing out the humor in my quirks. Because they love them and find them fascinating, and vice versa. And surely there are those who love and make fun of my quirks but refuse to be vulnerable around me themselves, and I don’t have much tolerance for that. It’s unfair, inequitable, unbalanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s what it comes down to, and what will drive my social decisions going forward. If I can’t be my true self around a person without being ridiculed, even lightly, we are not a good match. If the other person can’t be themselves around me, if they are constantly hiding under a cloak that they’ve woven to protect themselves and still insist on coming after me and my weird qualities, then I’ve decided I have no room in my life for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a mantra for everyone. Some people do just fine in relationships like these. But they don’t enrich my life. They drain me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I’m through with them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How A Song Arrives</title>

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been writing songs since I was 7. A family friend had given birth to a baby boy, and for whatever reason, I decided to write a song about it on piano. I don’t remember the process, though I do remember playing the song at recitals. My piano teacher even let me make sheet music for the song using Midi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, when I was 13, I wrote a poem that an older friend turned into a song. What a special thing to do, collaborating on music and lyrics. Again, I don’t remember the process. This was also the year I bought a guitar. And though I didn’t know how to tune it or play it, just its presence made me feel at ease. Like how some people feel about sleeping with a gun under their pillow except slightly less intense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Like how some people feel about sleeping with a gun under their pillow except slightly less intense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 14, I bought a new and better guitar and used the internet to learn some of my favorite songs. There was a song rattling around in my head, and so I created chords for it on guitar in about 20 mins. I don’t remember how it happened. I remember when it was done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since then I’ve had many guitars and I’ve written hundreds of songs. And I often describe the writing process as reception: I &lt;em&gt;receive&lt;/em&gt; a song from some kind of higher power. It comes gift wrapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noodling on the guitar brings about some interesting chord changes, and sometimes I’ll play a cool chord progression for a while until a song descends to claim the progression. It’s as if I have nothing to do with it at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’ve tried lately to catch myself, to observe what’s happening in my brain when these songs arrive. There’s one right now, on the tip of my tongue burning a hole in the roof of my mouth, trying to inject itself directly into my brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can just make out the melody there, in the distance. I hear cadences, rhythms, even words, and a general spirit of the song, but I couldn’t play it for you. It’s a fetus. All I’ve got are ultrasounds but those only show me the shape of the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point the song will be visible to me, the shadowy edges will become sharp, and the point of the song will smack my across the face. I already know the song by heart, but now I have to translate it into wave forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is how a song arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t go to meet it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has to make its way to me, like a weary traveler looking for a home.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Trickery Of Beauty</title>

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve never been in a rain storm in Arizona, it can be quite intense for a short period of time, and then out of nowhere, the clouds will vanish and the sun will return, like nothing ever happened. It’s almost as if someone hit the reset button, right as the storm started to peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in Tucson recently for one of these storms, so I took shelter. Afterward, I went for a walk by a pond, over a bridge. And as I crossed over the bridge, I noticed in the sky the stretchiest, most pot-of-gold looking rainbow I had ever seen in my life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;No one else was around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen rainbows before. When I was a kid, my mom used to call for my attention in a punchy but hushed voice every time she saw one (“&lt;em&gt;look Zia!! A rainbow!”&lt;/em&gt;) In DC, I’ll sometimes catch a small one as I gaze out of the train window on the way home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this? This was the type of rainbow that framed the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I immediately felt the need to take a picture with my phone. The first place I sent the photo was not Instagram, but to my wife, who was taking a walk in a different part of the same area. I expected a “wow” reply, but got this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It hadn’t even occurred to me that she would be looking at the same rainbow from where she was. The rainbow, and its beauty, was so personal to me in that moment without anyone else around, I forgot how the sky works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to remember this: beauty can be a source of trickery. It can make you feel like an experience is personal when it’s actually shared. We experience this every time we listen to a great record on a nice pair of headphones. It feels like it’s meant for us, like we’re the only ones listening… but there are copies of that same music streaming in other people’s headphones as well. Maybe even on the same train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s beautiful, in some ways. Maybe it’s disappointing to know that what was once considered to be a personal experience is actually a rather communal experience; it’s also nice to know that the personal experiences that make me feel alone are &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; communal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, we’re perhaps never really alone on anything even if we’re in solitude.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Heart Tickle</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-02-14-a-heart-tickle/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s fatherhood. Maybe it’s living in a house that I feel completely aligns with my taste and my character. Maybe it’s working a job that I absolutely love. Either way, I feel happy lately. I wake up every morning excited to be alive, excited to be a father and a husband, and excited to take on whatever challenges the day presents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting sensation that’s developed in the past few months is the feeling of what I describe as a heart tickle. It’s almost a sense of longing ness, like leaving someone you won’t see for a while, except they’re standing right there. It’s the wistful sensation of missing someone before they’ve even gone away. I don’t know what spurred it, or why it’s been so prevalent in my life lately.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I feel it when I think about my parents. I feel it when I think about my son, and my wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s not to say it’s a bad thing, in the same sense that physical tickling is not &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; thing. It can be uncomfortable, and can provide a little does of cognitive dissonance. Our faces are smiling, our voices are laughing, and we’re screaming “stop!! STOP!!!” through our tear streamed faces. It’s pure joy and discomfort all at once. There are few feelings like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting note is that this heart tickle feeling, it seems, cannot co-exist with anxiety. The more anxiety I feel, the less of a heart tickle there is. And maybe that’s what it comes down to. Having a life that makes me happy and not anxious brings forth a need to miss what hasn’t yet left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’ll take me some time to get used to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently finished Cal Newport’s outstanding book &lt;em&gt;Digital Minimalism&lt;/em&gt;. I’ve got so many thoughts, but my first one is that I need to delete social media apps from my phone. I’ve now deleted Facebook, and my Twitter is set permanently on my work account (which doesn’t suck me in, because I follow a limited amount of people). Instagram is always distracting but it’s not as bad as the other aforementioned apps, and I’ve just made a pact for today not to look at it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So it’s my first morning without social media in my face and I’m in the waiting room at my therapist’s office. Even though I brought my Kindle, I suddenly notice the stack of psychology magazines on the table in the waiting area. I pick one up and start to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it feels a little like that time last year when I listened to a CD for the first time in like 6 years and noticed how crisp everything sounded. The words are sharper, with better editing than you’d find on a Buzzfeed or click bait article (go figure). The content is based on actual documented research AND the summaries are not exaggerated the way they are online (no, wine is not better than exercise).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve never noticed these magazines before because I always browsed social media on my phone. I haven’t delved deeply into the actual articles yet. But this is the first of what I believe will be many revelations in a world where social media is restricted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Case For Multiple Reads</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was a classroom teacher, I used to teach a course called Close Reading of Complex Text. The idea behind the course is that if you give a student a text that is just slightly beyond their reading abilities (in other words, harder than a text they could understand by reading it one time, but not so hard that they give up), they will need to work hard to use their skills and extract meaning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;When I was a classroom teacher, I used to teach a course called Close Reading of Complex Text. The idea behind the course is that if you give a student a text that is just slightly beyond their reading abilities (in other words, harder than a text they could understand by reading it one time, but not so hard that they give up), they will need to work hard to use their skills and extract meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not a new idea for college and graduate students, who have to parse text constantly to extract meaning necessary to be effective in their class sessions. But for 3rd and 4th graders, this was a relatively new challenge, one brought on by changes in national standards (i.e. the common core).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more daunting was teaching it. &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; know how to access complex texts. How do you teach it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out there are a few different principles involved in teaching students how to access a piece of text that is probably too challenging for them, but of the strategies used, the major one is &lt;em&gt;reading the passage or text several times with different intentions each time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You read it once for pleasure, just to take it in. You might read it again to try and use context to understand unknown words. Perhaps a third time to think about specific motivations of characters, or to uncover a technical process. And maybe a fourth time to determine why the author wrote the piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s effective, and it also works with art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve watched the series Lost so many times now that I’ve gone beyond trying to understand the ending… I know want to understand the connections between the characters and their philosopher counterparts (like Desmond Hume being named after David Hume, John Locke, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve listened to Kind of Blue so many times that its meaning changes for me on a regular basis. It’s remarkable because the music is somewhat out of my grasp; I’m not a music theorist, though I am a musician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple views of Lost in Translation also gives a deeper edge to the movie, making it one of my favorites. I went from thinking that it wasn’t important to know what Bill Murray says to Scarlett at the end of the movie, to thinking that was important to at least have my own interpretation of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe a conclusion we could draw from this is that multiple listens/views is required to understand &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; that is complex and slightly out of reach. So the next time you don’t get something you read/watch/hear… try consuming it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What inspires me is not mastery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was talking to a friend of mine about my choice to play jazz guitar. The initial stages of learning this skill are quite slow, as I’m just collecting chords and playing them on the guitar (sometimes quite sloppily).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’ll be cool when you can just make your fingers dance around the guitar like a pro,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;“It’ll be cool when you can just make your fingers dance around the guitar like a pro,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I smiled and nodded, but deep down I felt an intense sense of disagreement with that statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, the idea of being able to jiggle around the guitar, to play solos that make heads spin and fires start, to maybe even join in a jam session with other musicians… all of it is exciting to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what’s most exciting to me is not the dream, it’s simply conquering &lt;em&gt;the step I’m currently on&lt;/em&gt;. And for now, that’s memorizing 27 chords (their names, and how to play them). I don’t care what’s beyond that at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of an aspiring writer, perhaps a young J.K. Rowling. She doesn’t necessarily dream of being one of the famous writers in the world. She dreams of finishing her first novel. No, she dreams of finishing her first &lt;em&gt;chapter&lt;/em&gt; for that novel. Maybe even the first &lt;em&gt;sentence.&lt;/em&gt; After that, maybe it’s just getting her book in front of agents, and then getting a deal, and then…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s discouraging and even disingenuous to define for a learner the meaning of “mastery” for their craft, whether you have experience in that craft or not. It’s misleading. Because a pro will tell you that the target is always moving, and that mastery is not some kind of target you will one day hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are little mini-targets, and the road never ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s always a treat to get a behind-the-scenes look at a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, this is the process that created some beloved piece of art. It’s a peak into what the creators had to go through. The trial, tribulation, pain, and pleasure in the act of creating something new and unique. We imagine that the behind-the-scenes is full of bustling artists, fast-talkers, and brilliant strokes of genius.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We imagine that the behind-the-scenes is full of bustling artists, fast-talkers, and brilliant strokes of genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we discover that the process behind most of the art we love was… well, kind of boring and hopeless. That the mixes on Abbey Road once sounded like shit before the release. That cleaning them up required a ton of work, none of which was very creative, exciting, or fun. Just tedious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And tedium is the name of the game when it comes to behind-the-scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As passive audience members, we can’t possibly imagine a world in which our favorite piece of art is a 9-5 job. It’s hard to believe that the producers of big TV shows were probably just stressed out most of the time. We romanticize the scenes that go on in the background of the art we consume, but the scenes are a lot like real life… boring and/or tedious.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What do you think of when I say the word nourishment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food, perhaps. Particularly food that is healthy, contains vitamins, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe it’s deeper than that. The dictionary says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s not just a reference to food, but can also include “other substances.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s not that the substances we use are the &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; of our good growth, health, and condition, it’s that they contribute to the environment that exists around us, and those variables make it easier to grow and be in good condition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s something so perfectly painful about pastries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to eat a pastry almost every day when I used to work in downtown DC. The truth is that the eating was a distraction from what I found to be an utterly boring desk job. If it wasn’t a pastry, it would be something else relatively unhealthy, like a can of Monster, or perhaps a sausage that spent most of its morning bathing in the juices of a cantaloupe in the office food court.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It was embarrassing to run into anyone down there, if I’m being honest. Even though I knew that they were getting the same pieces of cardboard bacon and watered down maple syrup in order to cope with their far-too-routinized lives, it was still a source of shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, I wanted to try something new, so I stopped by a nearby bakery on the way to work. I ordered what I thought would be a quick breakfast pastry; a small piece of key lime pie. After ordering it, the cashier took the key lime pie out of the shelf, put it into a little aluminum container with a plastic lid, tied a ribbon around that container, and put the whole work of art into a pretty heavy duty bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked into my cubicle that day with my laptop bag and a giant bag that had a bakery logo on it. My co-workers had to watch in their peripheral vision as I unwrapped every piece of the pastry puzzle. They watched as I struggled to remove the plastic top of the container. They watched as I took my first bite, as the little bits of powdered sugar covered my fingers. They watched as I tried to eat cleanly and neatly, and how I ended up with cream all over my face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They watched me eat a pastry in the most dignified way that I could, but I don’t think they would have described the act as dignified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, by the way, is what happens &lt;em&gt;every time&lt;/em&gt; I eat a pastry. There’s no dignity in pastry-eating, none. But it does kill the pain of living, just a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pastries. Painfully perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lessons From Rollercoaster Tycoon</title>

&lt;p&gt;I bought the game Rollercoaster Tycoon as a kid because I wanted some kind of immersive video gaming experience riding roller coasters. Turns out the game was actually a simulation of what it would be like to run a theme park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was disappointed to say the least, but back then I didn’t have another new game available, so I played tycoon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I bought the game Rollercoaster Tycoon as a kid because I wanted some kind of immersive video gaming experience riding roller coasters. Turns out the game was actually a simulation of what it would be like to run a theme park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was disappointed to say the least, but back then I didn’t have another new game available, so I played tycoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later, working for big companies and running my own businesses, I’ve realized that I actually learned a lot from this game. Two lessons that I remember about negotiating and the customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The way you “negotiate” in Rollercoaster tycoon is by extending your character’s hand to meet the hand of a potential investor. There’s no actual business strategy; it’s more like a hand eye coordination game. Keep clicking until your hand reaches the investor. Sure, negotiating is more than this in reality, but the visual of a hand pulling away and reaching out every few seconds is how a lot of negotiations go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever a new ride opens, a floor of people get on the ride. You can tell by their faces if the ride was enjoyable, if it fills a gap in the marketplace. At first, everyone is happy and smiling. At some point the lines get too long and people start getting mad and walking away. I used to get so anxious when it happened at first until I realized it was just what happens every time and it was possible to win even with unhappy customers. If they didn’t want to wait, that was understandable. Plenty of rides elsewhere in the park.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think about both of these all the time. Trying to agree on a path forward is just a version of the hand stretch game, just with emotion and logic. And customers will never be 100% happy, and that’s okay. We can make products for people who need them and let the others see themselves out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Midnight</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to love the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child, night was when &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; happened. Santa. Ghosts. Beer. Stars. Seinfeld. Everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In college, night was really the only time I got anything useful done. Editing video, coding. It was almost like the daytime didn’t count. Like the sunlight was a kind of barrier. Not so long ago, relatively speaking, people used to take the sunset as a clear signal to go to sleep. Not me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Not so long ago, relatively speaking, people used to take the sunset as a clear signal to go to sleep. Not me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It used to be no problem to stay up late. I’d be tired all the time, but at least I wasn’t missing out on all the night had to offer. Makes sense since teenagers are wired for night. But that wiring seemed to stick with me through my 20s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when friends started saying things like &lt;em&gt;whoops, it’s past my bedtime!&lt;/em&gt; at 10pm, I’d shudder and hope I’d never become like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure when it happened, but at some point my body rewired itself. I can’t stay up past 11 these days, though bedtime is usually earlier. Like confronting the monster under my bed, I finally had to accept that there was nothing I was missing out on by going to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the alertness I felt during the day was worth much more than the extra awake time bleary-eyed drinking Monster. Quality over quantity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the quality of my thoughts changed. I became a more positive person. And I wondered why it took me so long, especially with mom and dad telling me &lt;em&gt;go to sleep&lt;/em&gt; so many times for so many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We never learn, do we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or at least, if we do, it’s always on our own. No matter how obvious it is. No matter how many of our heroes say it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t learn until we teach ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tweak The Presets</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-02-05-tweak-the-presets/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember buying a walkman when I was a kid and getting to pick an audio preset when streaming FM radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presets were genre titles, like pop, rock, rap, jazz. The idea was that you could select the appropriate genre and the device would make that particular type of music sound even better. Same thing with the TV – there’s a presets for different levels of saturation and color settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;I remember buying a walkman when I was a kid and getting to pick an audio preset when streaming FM radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presets were genre titles, like pop, rock, rap, jazz. The idea was that you could select the appropriate genre and the device would make that particular type of music sound even better. Same thing with the TV – there’s a presets for different levels of saturation and color settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when I started using synth and other audio equipment, I’d often find a preset to use as an instrument. If I wanted a glitchy sound for instance, I’d search the presets for “glitchy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these presets were just specific settings for EQs and compressors, tools that non-audio folk don’t usually understand well. The presets were the manufacturers best guesses as to what the settings should be to evoke a particular sound or aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since the presets only covered a tiny fraction of the possibilities and combinations of settings, using them for anything other than a starting point became very limiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing is that presets also exist in life. The jobs we get. The friends we make. The experiences we have. There is a nearly automatic path for almost any situation. There’s the lawyer preset, the Juliard preset, the travel the world preset, the marriage preset, the have children preset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All configurations of settings that a person could choose and not feel like they are taking a huge risk or leap. These are paths that have already been paved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s entirely plausible for a person to exist on nothing but presets. There are people that load a preset on their lives and think, &lt;em&gt;okay, good enough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there the people that use the presets as a starting place, but they play with &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the buttons, sliders, and pots until the sound matches the vision in their head. We call this &lt;em&gt;tweaking&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;tinkering.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tweak is a choice, and it doesn’t require a lot of extra effort to do it… but it is worth it to create a life that is aligned to your vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what breaking from presets can offer: a unique life.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Favorite Parts Of Eighth Grade</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spoilers below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s a moment where Kayla is about to walk out into a pool party in her bright green swimsuit. Right as she works up enough courage, she pulls the screen door to the side and it gets stuck, causing her to walk out sideways. Such a real moment. That element of surprise in an already intense moment is something Bo Burnham does exceedingly well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At one point, Kayla lies to a boy in her class about her oral sex skills, which results in her looking up a tutorial on YouTube, which results in her trying to practice on a banana, and her dad almost catches her. After that, the camera cuts to a scene where she’s googling “things shaped like a banana.” Small moment but absolutely perfect. It captures the ore sexual angst of middle school without oversexualizing it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She gives up making YouTube videos at one point, claiming to her nearly nonexistent audience that she talks about a lot of things but doesn’t actually do them. We later discover in her 6th grade time capsule that she’d made a video for her future self. And she follows that up with making a video for herself as a high school senior. She discovers what we as the audience kind of knew all along: the videos were for &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;, and no one else. The videos were her way of processing her own life. And really, doesn’t that describe most YouTubers? Most artists?&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Two Types Of Friendship</title>

&lt;p&gt;There are two types of friendships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one, or the one that most of us are accustomed to, is spread across days like jelly. We start small, maybe in a class or at the office, getting to know each other. Maybe we have a meal or a coffee and figure out what we have in common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we meet every few weeks for a movie, or a TV binge. Maybe we text about our problems when the sea gets rough.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Maybe we meet every few weeks for a movie, or a TV binge. Maybe we text about our problems when the sea gets rough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the type of friendship that is maintained drop by drop, year after year, through passive maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second type is the condensed kind. I’ve only spent 10-20 weeks total with my two cousins who live in England. But our time spent together was efficient; bonding was quick because we had an instant connection being family and having similar quirks, and when we did get together we had pre-established routines and intense periods of time spent arguing, playing, and living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither of these types is better than the other, but they both need different methods in order to nurture the friendship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intense, condensed friendships need structure and routine. A work trip, for instance, with people you don’t see every day could provide the right amount of structure. Or in the case of my cousins, a family vacation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spread out kind requires passive maintenance. It requires lots of day-to-day musings. It requires scheduling and effort and occasionally structure when life becomes unwieldy. It’s why a lot of spread out friendships tend to fall apart. A 30 minute drive can become an ocean as we start to fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a spiritual balance. If you only have one of these type of friendships in your life, consider seeking the other kind. Both expand the mind and heart in intense but unique ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only it’s just a normal storm. It’s over in an hour. I watch it end from the window of my hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palm trees are more dramatic than even the ocean or the clouds. And whether it’s MTV or Netflix or the 9 o’clock news, TV is merely a window for drama.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Like the wind beneath this plane right now. Drama, at least on the receiving end. Natural otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate drama. But that is dramatic. And to be honest, I love drama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing lasts forever is drama. Things that are the way you don’t want them to be is drama. The way I react so viscerally to just the very idea that my expectations did not meet reality, that’s drama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love all of it, and I loathe all of it too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If I’m ever asked about love, joy, sadness, triumph, fatherhood… my response these days is usually the same for all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a feeling so big,” I tell everyone, “that I have to break it into pieces just to understand it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like dissecting frogs or anything else involving the scientific process, I have to examine all the angles. It’s not enough to just feel joy anymore; I have to understand how it was constructed, how the gears fit together, how the machine functions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Because then, in a modular way, I could build new emotional systems, ones that are more efficient, ones that carry me through clouds, through the front door, and into a hot shower.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Soul Has No Beat</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The thing about a calling is that it’s really easy to ignore. There are people that go their whole lives without hearing it, despite how &lt;em&gt;loud&lt;/em&gt; it can call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the urge, when I was three, to tell people how to do things. Perhaps it was a bit bossy, but the fact that I’m now an educator isn’t surprising in retrospect. And the fact that even before I was an educator, teaching was the part of my consulting job I connected to the most.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I made up songs in the shower since age 6, and am still a working singer songwriter. The ability to mystify using magic was the start of my passion for storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I didn’t hear these callings, not until later. And it’s possible I would’ve never heard them at all, if it weren’t for my mentors. That’s the value of a mentor; getting the mentee to tune in, to listen to the calling coming from their own soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the soul is the thing that is hardest to hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t beat like a heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It whispers like a stream.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Real Tips For Fighting An Oncoming Cold</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I was getting sick over the last couple of days. My throat got really raw, and I felt the discomfort starting to move around from my throat to my nose. I have a business trip coming up that requires public speaking so I needed to act fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many who say that there is no way to shorten the duration of a cold or to lessen the symptoms. But based on being a teacher and experimenting with remedies, I disagree. Here are some ways I’ve managed to stomp sickness before it starts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The key with any of these is to start the moment you get a first hint of a cold. Slightly scratchy throat, headache, whatever that means for you. Once you’re a stuffy monster, none of this stuff will really help much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skratch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can buy this on amazon. It’s meant for athletes. It’s a powdered drink mix. For whatever reason (probably hydration) it has helped me dodge many colds. I drink two cups of it (more sometimes) every day that o feel like I’m getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Umcka&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get tablets of umcka root at CVS or amazon. This is what actors use to prevent getting sick. My mother in law told me about it, and combined with Skratch, it’s the real deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zicam&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use this as a just in case. Research seems to suggest that zinc really helps right at the onset of a cold, so I add this into the mix if I’m going all out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep at 7pm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rest is arguably the most important factor on the list. You have to rest in order to get better. Your body has to heal itself. Go to bed at 7. If anything, you’ll get the immense satisfaction of finally getting enough sleep for once. That’s almost reason enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course then you’ll wake up at 4am to write the blog post you normally write at night. But that’s an acceptable compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long Term Exposure To Music</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve long felt that music has had a profound effect on who I am. It’s not so much the type of music I listen to, but that I listen to it so intently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned to love so many different kinds of music. In my 20’s, they were almost like phases. I went through an ambient music phase, an opera phase, a classical phase, an experimental phase…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’ve always wondered what long term effect all this music has had on my brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But I’ve always wondered what long term effect all this music has had on my brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember being told, a few times in my life, that it feels like my earbuds/headphones are surgically attached to my ears. And this might be true. Ever since I got headphones at the age of 4 or 5, I’ve poured hours and hours of music into my brain without much thought. And even before headphones, I was spinning vinyl records at age 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that a Stanford study found that the more that people listen to music, the better their memories are. This lines up with what I know about myself. I have one of the best memories among the people I know. Sometimes it scares people how much I remember. I haven’t read the study fully, but I do know that I tend to tie memories and music together. I can listen to a song that I haven’t heard in years and remember the last place I heard it. Where I was, what I was wearing, who was with me, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another study looked at the language skills of those who are exposed to lots of music. There are connections between language and music. It makes sense that I’m a writer, and that I feel natural when I’m speaking to a crowd. Musicality teaches rhythm and prosody, and those are also really important when speaking and writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t do anything about my addiction to music. It’s permanent. But music is one drug I am happy to submit to.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that I love our house. I’ve loved it from the moment I walked in during the open house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the way it looks. Regal and sturdy on the outside, sun streaming through the big living room window, hardwood floors that get painted so perfectly by the 3pm light. The way that the living room feels so endless and the downstairs den feels like a cozy spaceship.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I love the way that it smells. The hardwood floors smell quite woody, and in the kitchen you can smell the granite island (I’m not actually sure you can smell it, but I can’t figure out what else could be producing that odor).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most of all, I love the way it sounds. The hardwood floors creak when I walk over them on a Sunday morning. And when there’s a strong gust of wind, the house makes a cracking noise as if the walls are flexing to protect us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think everyone would agree there’s something special about a childhood home. For better or for worse. This is the place my kid gets to grow up. In a beautiful house full of character and with a &lt;em&gt;super secret&lt;/em&gt; crawl space in the basement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps he will use it as a portal, traveling to distant dark and rocky worlds. Or maybe it will be his cool down spot when he’s angry at us in high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those couch cushions are going to be tunnels at some point. I hadn’t factored that in when we bought the couch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when the kids are sliding down the stairs on air mattresses, remind me to close my eyes and let the laughter I hear serve as a reminder that more than anything, I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; the sound of the house.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Choosing Words</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-01-22-choosing-words/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose your words carefully.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poets do it. Advertisers do it. Because certain combinations of words touch images, memories, and triggers in people’s minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes in conversation, it’s harder to choose words. Thinking before you speak only goes so far, because a conversation is an act of improvisation and therefore can’t consist of well-chosen words 100% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, words are important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a clear difference between the meanings of obfuscate (render unclear or unintelligible) and block (make movement difficult or impossible), yet they are sometimes used interchangeably.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Or certain catch phrases like, &lt;em&gt;I could care less,&lt;/em&gt; which don’t mean what we intend them to mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to use to say how much I &lt;em&gt;hated&lt;/em&gt; the software we used to use at work, until my colleague pointed out that hate is a strong word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing about choosing words carefully in an online conversation is that it’s easier to do compared to real life, but rarely do online pontificators think before posting, unless they’re a professional, or just dedicated to the craft.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Spiritual Life Starts From Within</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-01-21-a-spiritual-life-starts-from-within/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was listening to an old On Being interview with Mary Oliver, the poet who died last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interview, she advocated for everyone to have a spiritual life, that having a spiritual life is the perfect way to deepen and enhance the way a person interacts with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m sure many people don’t know what that means. I sure didn’t. Does that mean we need to subscribe to religion? Or pray? Or meditate?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But I’m sure many people don’t know what that means. I sure didn’t. Does that mean we need to subscribe to religion? Or pray? Or meditate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended a class recently, a quick one hour thing, where this very idea was discussed. We talked about wisdom, about love, and about service. But two stories really stuck with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were talking about the idea of solitude, being without people. And how this one lady created a makeshift temple in her parked car outside of her home every day when she returned from work. The kids weren’t allowed to interrupt, neither was her husband. It was her time to be alone, to let whatever was rattling around in her mind come to a stand still. Solitude must be, I figure, a cornerstone of spirituality. No input from others, just your own pure interpretation of your surrounding stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second story was more of a fable. It went something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone used to be a god. Until for whatever reason they had their divinity stripped from them for doing something ungodly. And the higher gods talked about where they should hide this divinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they hid it in the ocean, then they argued people would find a way to dive down and find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they hid it on the tallest mountain, they argued people would hike up and find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they chose to break it into pieces and hide it &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; every single person. Because who would think to look internally for divinity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s this idea of &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; that brings me peace. Everything we are capable of comes from the internal world. Every choice, every taste, every great love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe spirituality is the habit of looking inward first, in solitude, to find the forward-moving walkway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s the counterintuitive practice of refusing to search the world for the answers, and &lt;em&gt;allowing&lt;/em&gt; yourself to access that deep and dormant part of you that is overflowing with wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hatred As A Transaction</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are people out there whose sole focus is to get you to love them. So they do things that they think will make you love them; they will ask about your life, the records you’ve been into, the food you like, the meaning of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there are people who want to inspire hatred toward themselves. They are the ones who troll, who post nasty comments on the YouTube channels of children. They are the people who yuck your yum. They crave interaction, and inspiring hatred is the cheapest interaction of all because doing so activates our defenses in no time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes these people have &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; characteristics. They want love from one group and hate from another. More interactions, more purpose, more meaning… even if they have to buy an exclusive Wu Tang album to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these are two different transactions. The transaction of love is time and energy well spent. It’s finding someone else in the world who loves the way you do. The hate transaction leaves us feeling even more alone than before. It outlines our differences. It only benefits the hater by inflating their power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t let them make you hate them. No matter what.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Whats Innovative</title>

title = &amp;ldquo;01&amp;rdquo;

+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was working on a consulting project last year in which one of the words used to describe our eventual work was “innovative”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always liked how that word sounds, but haven’t been able to always fully define it. Society likes it too, because it’s written everywhere in an attempt to make jobs sound more modern, or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia says innovation is a new method, idea, or product. Most of our ideas are “new,” but maybe not massively useful. Is it still innovation?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always liked how that word sounds, but haven’t been able to always fully define it. Society likes it too, because it’s written everywhere in an attempt to make jobs sound more modern, or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia says innovation is a new method, idea, or product. Most of our ideas are “new,” but maybe not massively useful. Is it still innovation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it innovation if I make sandwich that has meat out on the outside and bread on the inside? Or is it &lt;em&gt;just a new idea?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I asked the lead consultant on the project what it means to him to be innovative. I asked him if it’s just a swap word for &lt;em&gt;creativity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Creativity is connecting two unlike ideas to create a new one, at least that’s how I see it,” he said. “Innovation, at least in our work, is using best practices in one industry and applying them to a new solution in another industry. Cross-industry work is innovative. It breaks patterns that many industries follow, so it’s useful. You’ve been a teacher and a technology consultant before. Have you ever used something unique to consulting to help you teach more effectively or efficiently?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a consultant, I’d used a spreadsheet macro, which records all of your movements in a spreadsheet so you can run stock reports on new data and produce automated reports, in order to solve a long-standing client problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when I started teaching, I realized that some of the longest hours on the job were spent inputting numbers and colors into a spreadsheet. I spent an entire winter break automating the process, calculating a savings of many hours throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing was that when I figured out these automation tricks, my inclination was to tell &lt;em&gt;everyone.&lt;/em&gt; So I made YouTube videos and told anyone who would listen to me that they could save time grading and planning if they used some of my automated macros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction I got from nearly everyone was: “Cool that you came up with this, great that you’re saving time… but it’s not something I really need.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excitement, but no willingness to implement. Everyone loving the idea of saving time, but not interested in changing habits to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habit changes are hard, after all, and they require serious motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it goes to show that if you build it, people won’t necessarily come. It’s more than that. And furthermore, it means that &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; innovative ideas have probably died due to lack of effort. It’s a shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying you need to dedicate your days to exploring new and innovative solutions to problems, because that would become tiresome. But I am saying that if you have the opportunity to do something in a new way, and it won’t hurt your bottom line of time or money… do it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I received a package in the mail that I’ve been waiting for since the new year started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t quite sure when it would arrive, and I checked the mail incessantly. There was no tracking number or notification service letting me know when it would be out for delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it arrived today. I nearly tackled the mailman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside of the package were four books, full of words that I’d already read… because I’d written them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Inside of the package were four books, full of words that I’d already read… because I’d written them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve written before about my journaling habit. Ive been going online now for nine years, almost daily. I say almost because between 2010-2014, I wrote maybe 3-5 times a week. After that, it was daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I used email services like OhLife, that would email me every day asking how my day was. I would reply and my response would go into a private database, and the same email would also tell me what I wrote a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I wrote a script in Ruby that imported all of my entries into an app called DayOne, which also allowed me to add pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DayOne has the feature of being able to order a beautiful photo book that makes a beautiful display of photos and text. I ordered 4 books – 9 years of journal entries. And while these aren’t for the public, they give me exactly what I want – a lab notebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lab notebook contains the objective observations of life. Not like this blog, which is full of analysis. My journal is just a list of things I did or things I feel. The very fragments of my mind, poured out onto paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read about my wedding, I read about my career changes (2 of them), I read about finding out my wife was pregnant. Then I read about my child being born and the days that followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw how far I’ve come, and got a glimpse of where I’m headed (but only a glimpse).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a window and a mirror and a data sheet all in one.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Escalators: stand to the right, walk to the left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until someone forgets this unspoken and unposted rule, and stands jutting out a little bit into the left side of the moving stairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s impolite, it breaks the norm… but then, the escalator is short, and the ride is only a few more seconds. Saying something to the esca-lefter would be assertive, but would save me about two extra seconds, at this point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;And so by the time I work up the nerve to even confront the esca-lefter, we are up the escalator, and all of my frustrations are no longer relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forget about the whole thing. This happens multiple times a day in different situations, each with their own minor inconveniences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what they mean when they say not to sweat the small stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Input From Other Minds</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cal Newport, on a podcast recently, talked about his new book on digital minimalism. It’s the idea that we need to start thinking about what we consume online just like we do with food consumption. That our online habits are making us unhealthy. That we should remove all unhealthy inputs for a while and then only add back in the ones that have actual value, as opposed to the strictly habitual ones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

That we should remove all unhealthy inputs for a while and then only add back in the ones that have actual value, as opposed to the strictly habitual ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He mentioned that everyone needs some solitude in their day, and he defines that as “freedom from the input of other people’s minds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s kind of beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we are alone and browsing Twitter, it’s still not solitude because we are still receiving input from other people’s minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we are on the sea alone and reading a book, it’s still not solitude because the book is input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same with listening to music or watching tv. Being alone doesn’t necessarily equate to solitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about how often I actually achieve solitude. Mostly it’s when I write, like right now, and perhaps this is not only freedom from other people’s input, but a focused beam of light from my own mind’s input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe that’s why reflection is so powerful. It’s solitude and intra-personal connection rolled into one habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also why my best ideas come to me in the shower, and why I have waterproof pad in my master bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out my best ideas are the ones that come directly from me when I leave my mind simmering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything else is covered by input from others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some days, I’m coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wake up with purpose. My bed is made. I’m at the kitchen table reading the paper an hour before work. The kids have dressed themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enter the conference call with confidence. I speak my name as a trochee, emphasis on the first syllable. I’m not asking, I’m telling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bust through the to do list like I’m cranking a lever. By noon I’ve finished my most important tasks. I’ve set goals for the rest of the week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I love like it’s the last day on earth. I grip my kid like I’m holding a bat at home plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pour through grinds ferociously. I’m satisfied and, like I expected, I fit right into the shape of the cup. I might die tomorrow, or I might live for a hundred years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some days, I’m tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get out of bed as if I’m immortal. Every day has little relative importance, but worth living nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make my day up on the spot. I write new songs and throw away old ones. I play solitaire, or Jenga. I walk in the park for an hour, maybe two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work on the initial stages of the project. I figure there’s always tomorrow. And if not, then there’s always later today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sing like a warm hug, I take in the smell of your shirt, the just-done laundry. I let you lie on my chest, fall asleep there even. You sigh at the lights like they’re the most beautiful thing you’ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I seep through the molecules in the air and my thoughts start to expand. I don’t fit in the cup, the cup is just a construct. I am bigger than the bag, I am stronger than the cloves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today? Today I am soda. Today my mind keeps igniting with bursts of motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then my thoughts glide invisibly into the air, slowly, carefully, one bubble at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Danger Of The Noodle Power Structure</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Years ago, I had a set of supervisors whom I would describe as &lt;em&gt;noodles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A noodle is a people-manager who is rigid in their ways, but breaks very easily. When you put a noodle in metaphorical hot water, they bend and curl up, letting fear and pain drive their choices. They are destined to live their days in boiling broth swimming around in a pathetic loop of hate-fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever had a supervisor that’s a noodle, you’ve likely experienced their wrath for things that would get &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; in trouble with &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; boss. A noodle has no values of their own, at least none that they can talk about publicly for fear of pissing off their boss, or even appearing to disagree with their boss. It’s this element of corporate culture that makes us want to leave it all behind and start a ski/beach shop somewhere remote.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They are destined to live their days in boiling broth swimming around in a pathetic loop of hate-fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever had a supervisor that’s a noodle, you’ve likely experienced their wrath for things that would get &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; in trouble with &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; boss. A noodle has no values of their own, at least none that they can talk about publicly for fear of pissing off their boss, or even appearing to disagree with their boss. It’s this element of corporate culture that makes us want to leave it all behind and start a ski/beach shop somewhere remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s easy to understand the need to be agreeable with a boss even if you have a dissenting opinion. They control the appearance of a paycheck after all. But when we buy into that a little too much, it can lead to &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; of misery. And if we manage people below us, it can lead to years of misery for them. It’s an act of cruelty. But it happens all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to break free of this fear-hate loop if we ever want to grow as practitioners. It means taking a stand, pushing back, developing better relationships. After all, isn’t it better to agree with your boss because your visions are &lt;em&gt;aligned&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, do all the stuff that’s hard to do. It’s much easier to be a noodle than it is to decide what we want, to own the choices we make, and to make a difference in the lives of those we serve.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Systems Thinking And My Deficiencies</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’re all born with gifts, and we’re all born with anti-gifts. Skills that seem to come naturally to others but are a total mystery to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those, for me, is Tetris. Being able to fit pieces into gaps, being able to think ahead in a spatial way… are not skills in which I excel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also bad at having a thick skin. As a highly sensitive person, this never came naturally to me. Other things that never came naturally include being organized and punctual. Maybe it was nature, maybe nurture, but it doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere around college, I’d had enough of being late with things, forgetting appointments, and letting people down. So I started reading about the GTD system, which I’ve written about many times, and implementing not only changed my life, but I would argue it saved my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first “system” I’d ever tried, and the results were monumental and still help me today, 15 or so years later. I became obsessed. What other systems might help me fill in the gaps that my deficiencies have left me with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To name a few:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Konmarie tidying system could help me organize my physical objects more effectively, though I haven’t really implemented it fully.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A weight training program, like New Rules of Lifting, has helped me tremendously. I no longer need to figure out what to do at the gym. I follow the prescribed steps, and I see results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meal kit systems like Hello Fresh or Plated have taught me how to cook after years and years of trying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goal and Habit Trackers, and the so-called Seinfeld system, or don’t break the chain, has helped me stay active in my projects (in addition to having a functional to do list).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The system outlined in The Power of Habits by Charles Duhigg has helped me to change my habits in ways that I was oblivious to before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, any time that I need to make a huge change to my life, I create some kind of system. When my son was born, I developed a system for keeping our house tidy so that we wouldn’t raise him living in clutter. It’s probably something that a naturally organized and tidy person wouldn’t need, but I have tried for years to stay tidy with no luck. So far, we’ve gotten lots of surprised faces at how clean our house is when people come over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I worked in the classroom, my students can tell you that we had a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of systems. One of them, for instance, included see through folders on the wall, one for each student in alphabetical order, for them to turn in work. I could see whose work was missing, and collect the papers in alphabetical order, which reduced the cognitive effort needed to input the grades into a spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I developed a system for giving feedback on 4th grade essays which was pretty complex, but it allowed me to enter in multiple rubric scores and automatically generate a checklist and paragraph of feedback for each student. I could grade 60 one-paragraph papers in about 20 minutes on a good day, whereas the process used to take hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I outline my process for making a system as such:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I figure out what my system will automate in my life. Even if it’s not technology oriented, instilling a habit so that a process is nearly automatic (like brushing your teeth every morning) takes away the cognitive load.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I do research to figure out what may have worked for other people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I figure out the exact steps and frequency of the steps needed to achieve a functional habit loop or system where I don’t need to intervene too much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I implement it and scale it and review it. If it works, I keep it, and if it’s not working, I adjust it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many people who laugh at the lengths I go through to create and maintain these systems, but that’s because they’re missing the point. The point of these systems is to make life a little less chaotic, yes, but it’s also to remove a lot of unnecessary thinking so that I can focus on being a creative parent and consultant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not always easy work. In fact, it’s difficult quite often. There are some systems I’ve been tweaking for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But… it is a lot better than waking up every day and trying to tackle the day in an improvisatory way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Upside To Subscriptions</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-01-10-the-upside-to-subscriptions/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember the days of paying $300 for a piece of software. That $300 was a one-time fee, and you’d get even get a real box and CD-ROM. That piece of software might generate a decade of utility before it’s worthless. Software updates would be frequent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, most of the services I use are subscription-based. I pay for them monthly or yearly at a discount. The only exception is my beloved Omnifocus, though I do pay for an upgrade every 5 years (my back of the envelope calculations say that I’ve paid a dollar or two per month for this life changing app).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;There are some who argue that subscription based services are irritating and that the trend could be expensive for consumers. I have a different take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, subscriptions &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be more expensive, but back in the day where software came with a one-time fee, I bought a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more software. Now, I’m pretty considerate about what I decide to spend money on. I think about the alternatives before starting a monthly subscription. And with free trials (or being able to cancel after a month), I can say that it’s probably &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; costly to use something based on a subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s because there are many more ways to accomplish computer-related tasks these days. Even the act of keeping track of subscriptions. I could use Excel, Google Sheets, or Airtable. I can decide if the subscription fee for Airtable makes sense given the extra features and workflows it gives me over a traditional spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when the year begins, I can look over all my subscriptions and cut ones that weren’t that useful to me. This act in and of itself is cleansing but also educational; I’ve learned that I spend a lot on stuff that generates relatively low utility, and this has caused me to think twice or even thrice before starting a trial of something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside, of course, is forgetting that you’ve subscribed to something until you’ve shelled out hundreds of dollars for it over the years. Keep a spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Movie Trailers Soften The Blow</title>

&lt;p&gt;I used to love movie trailers as a kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much that I’d be upset if I was late and missed even one of them. There was something magical to me about the telling of these mini-stories. I loved following up by seeing the movie advertised and would get excited when I’d notice a scene from the trailer and how it fit into the film.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So much that I’d be upset if I was late and missed even one of them. There was something magical to me about the telling of these mini-stories. I loved following up by seeing the movie advertised and would get excited when I’d notice a scene from the trailer and how it fit into the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until it all changed one day, when I saw the movie Room. I won’t say what it’s about to avoid spoilers and also because it doesn’t matter what it was about. What made the experience of Room different for me was that I &lt;em&gt;didnt see the trailer&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, I hadn’t heard or watched anything about it, despite the fact that it was based on a book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve seen the film, then you know just how jarring that must have been. It was the most unbelievable experience. I was literally on the edge of my seat. I had &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; idea what I was in for. If I had, the blow would’ve been softened. And I don’t want soft blows when it comes to movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I’ve realized that all trailers do essentially the same thing: they tell the story of the movie, with most of the key scenes, and leave out the ending. Good thing, because otherwise there’d be no need to see the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if a movie requires 2 hours to tell a story and previews are able to condense the story into 2 mins to entice viewers to see it, then aren’t we being exposed to elements of s story without the details? And doesn’t that affect how we receive the movie when we watch it for the first time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying we should do away with trailers. One great trailer was for the Man on Wire movie, which simply showed the character high up on a skyscraper, about to walk across a tightrope. But then, that was a bio pic, so not much “story” was needed to entice viewers. Imagine doing the same idea but for a rom com. Not as effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would make more sense, perhaps, to just share a one min scene from the movie. This is maybe less enticing, but with a good movie, this could be effective in drawing in viewers &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; not give it all away. Imagine seeing just the first scene of Up for instance. It’s enough to make you want to stay for the rest. It’s a radical idea, but the current style of movie trailers can ruin the experience of a truly good film by laying out the story structure in your mind before you actually see the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We changed the style of previews once before by ditching narration. I say let’s do it again.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Best Piece Of Advice For Expecting Parents</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-01-08-best-piece-of-advice-for-expecting-parents/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//localhost:1313/posts/2019-01-08-best-piece-of-advice-for-expecting-parents/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While my wife and I were expecting our first child, I often asked a question to parents that I would meet: &lt;em&gt;what is one thing you wish had been told before the birth of your child, and one thing that you were told very often that didn’t end up true for you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answers were interesting and definitely will be the subject of an upcoming video or post, but I’m now being asked by the same people what I would say if I was giving advice to expecting parents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;While my wife and I were expecting our first child, I often asked a question to parents that I would meet: &lt;em&gt;what is one thing you wish had been told before the birth of your child, and one thing that you were told very often that didn’t end up true for you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answers were interesting and definitely will be the subject of an upcoming video or post, but I’m now being asked by the same people what I would say if I was giving advice to expecting parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few things I could think of to say to an expecting parent. I’d tell them not to worry about the carseat/stroller debacle, because most of the models are quite similar. I’d tell them not to Google &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; that their child is doing and find a pediatrician they trust. Actually, I’d tell them not to trust the internet in general when it comes to children (see previous post on The Internet’s Baby). All of these are things people had mentioned to me before having a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one piece of advice I wish I’d gotten?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Work out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, work out, for months in advance so that you are prepared for the physical burden of having a baby. It is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; easy to carry a growing thing that starts at a meager few pounds but grows a little every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a benefit to the fact that your child grows just a little every day, which is that there is some scaling built into the plan. If I’m used to holding a 7lb baby for instance, I won’t be shocked when I’m suddenly holding a 7.1lb baby in a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But other than that…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lifting a baby out of a crib is the exact movement you’d do with a Romanian deadlift, or even lifting a barbell off of a box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pushing a stroller requires quad and arm strength. Pushing exercises like push-ups or chest presses would mimic this motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do squats all the time while I’m holding the baby and trying to pick something up off of the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He usually hangs over my left shoulder when I’m carrying him, so I do shoulder presses to train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing exercises that promote a straight back, like a deadlift or squat, is useful since you’ll be wearing your baby on your chest sometimes and you don’t want to hunch too much without realizing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not the strongest person, naturally. I started working out so that I could lose weight and be ready to chase my kid around, and I’m sure cardio skills will come in handy eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for new parents, I recommend lifting weights. A great program is “The New Rules of Lifting” by Lou Schuyler and Alwyn Cosgrove. I’ve used it for years and have never tired of it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Magic Of Time Blocking</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I read about a radical idea a couple years ago. At least it was radical to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was researching procrastination because I felt like I wasn’t getting enough done despite having quite a few hours in the day to do things. I felt like I was wasting time but couldn’t quite figure out where the time was going. Like all the missing socks eaten by the washer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to track my time in the same way a dieter tracks calories. I used an app called rescue time that tracked how I spent my time online. I’d get a report emailed to me every week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I started to track my time in the same way a dieter tracks calories. I used an app called rescue time that tracked how I spent my time online. I’d get a report emailed to me every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found out that my suspicions were true. About 70%(!) of my time was spent watching videos and being on social media. This number shifted to 40% during grad school or times of heavy workloads. Still, it was clear I was spending too much time on what Peter Drucker calls TWAs, or Time Wasting Activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But tracking what I was doing online was only helpful in allowing me to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; the problem. Each weekly report I’d feel ashamed and then get another similar report the next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I discovered time blocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is that you plan your entire day in increments of 30 minutes. Even your free time to watch movies goes into the schedule. The idea is not to deny yourself things like social media or YouTube, but just to do a better job of planning time for the important stuff too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also advised in the many blog posts I read on the topic to stay flexible. If you veer from the path it’s okay, as long as you try your best to stick to it. Even the mere act of making the plan is better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easiest to do this with pen and paper, but I wanted to be able to see it quickly wherever I happened to me, and my phone is always on me. So I needed an app. I tried a few that were way too cumbersome, like Sorted. I already have a very robust task management system, so I didn’t need project lists or connections to my calendar. I also tried just using a regular old notepad app but that also ended up being too cumbersome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter the app Long Day. Super simple – a daily layout in increments of 30 minutes, and you just fill in the blanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already feel better having mapped out my evening. Now I just need to stick to it. What’s nice is that if I follow this plan, I will have worked out &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; made progress on my book and music… and still have YouTube time if I want it. (The open slots are for child care, or I would’ve mapped out the whole day.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a completeness to this that is uncomfortable at first. But if you have a busy life that needs taming, this might be a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>3 Places To Find Poetry In Life</title>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conversation. Next time you’re talking to a friend, be aware of metaphors in conversation. Even if they’re cliches. Throw the baby out with the bath water for instance. I remember a friend of mine once saying “I had to get up at the butt crack of dawn.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advertising. If you see an ad on the subway with copy (words), those words were carefully chosen, revised, chopped up, and re-ordered. The only thing that separates this from poetry is that the words are used to sell. The words in a poem evoke a sense of self, and an ad does that so you connect with the product on a personal level. Some advertising is written in pure iambs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jokes. Put line breaks in a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; comedy routine and it’s a poem. A funny poem, but a poem nonetheless. I say “great comedy routine” because if it’s great, the words were carefully chosen to evoke a profound sense of self. To awaken a memory or speak an unspoken truth.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There was a time in my music career when I wanted to be famous. I dreamed of playing to huge audiences at large amphitheaters. I loved the idea of thousands of fans buying my records. If there was a word for what I wanted, it was &lt;em&gt;glory&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I read Steven Pressfield’s &lt;em&gt;War of Art&lt;/em&gt; and in the first chapter, he talks about how this kind of thinking is the behavior of an amateur. That wanting fame and glory and rose petals thrown at you is detrimental to the actual creative process, which can be grueling, lonely, and thankless.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;There was a time in my music career when I wanted to be famous. I dreamed of playing to huge audiences at large amphitheaters. I loved the idea of thousands of fans buying my records. If there was a word for what I wanted, it was &lt;em&gt;glory&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I read Steven Pressfield’s &lt;em&gt;War of Art&lt;/em&gt; and in the first chapter, he talks about how this kind of thinking is the behavior of an amateur. That wanting fame and glory and rose petals thrown at you is detrimental to the actual creative process, which can be grueling, lonely, and thankless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book, which I highly recommend to any creative, focuses on the idea that creative work needs a practice. It needs to be done without thinking about fame and glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I began my pursuit of a music career in which I worked solely on my craft. A career in which I was productive and proactive. I focused on the craft and let the idea of fame sift into the back of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started playing bars in my 20s, background music mostly, for very little pay. But it was part of growing my craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I started playing more specialized shows, concerts where people actually paid a ticket price to come and listen. And some of the concerts I played in my late 20’s resulted in some pretty good money, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, my audience started to grow. As a result of my focus on craft, I had actually attained a small but perceptible level-up. I was well on my way to fame. I had opened up for some of my childhood heroes. I had finally played a venue that I had dreamed about playing for about a decade. And on that night, someone asked me the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So what’s the next level?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked around at many of my peers who had been grinding for years in the local music industry. Many of them were doing the same thing as me, just more frequently. It turns out that there’s a difference between being a professional musician and a beloved artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professionals grind. They show up every day. They improve their skills. Sometimes things are good and sometimes they’re hustling for work. They meet the needs of a customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beloved artists make and share art that speaks to their heart. The number of fans they have can vary from person to person. But a beloved artist would be satisfied if they were only loved by their spouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s overlap, of course. Prince was both a beloved artist &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a professional. Bowie also comes to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are people like Steve Gadd, who has played drums on so many famous studio albums, but unless you’re a musician, it’s unlikely you’ve heard of him. But he has a following in the music community, and that following has allowed for creative freedom, so perhaps he’s a professional that eventually became a beloved artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, I eventually made the choice to be a beloved artist, even if the loving audience is my friends and family. I realized that the work I do is better if I’m not under a deadline, or if there’s an expectation from a record label, or a legion of fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I don’t want to be famous anymore. I don’t care about a record deal. I don’t care about millions of fans. I don’t care about hustling my music around and trying to fit my art into whatever box the world wants. I’ll leave that to others who are much better suited for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I’ll just settle for creating, sharing, and creating again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a joy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Internets Baby</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to google health things incessantly. If my head hurt, if my skin was unusually dry, if my mouth felt weird… I’d google the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can guess how that went. After a while, I turned into a full blown cyberchondriac, which is the same as being a hypochondriac, except you not only believe you have illnesses you don’t have, but you also google the &lt;em&gt;shit&lt;/em&gt; out of those symptoms until you’re &lt;em&gt;all but convinced&lt;/em&gt; that you are dying.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

After a while, I turned into a full blown cyberchondriac, which is the same as being a hypochondriac, except you not only believe you have illnesses you don’t have, but you also google the &lt;em&gt;shit&lt;/em&gt; out of those symptoms until you’re &lt;em&gt;all but convinced&lt;/em&gt; that you are dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I went through this phase in my 20’s. While my son has been relatively healthy, I’m sure I’d be googling up a storm with every little hiccup if I was in my old frame of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned to a friend once, a parent of a two year old, that while I don’t google symptoms or health stuff, I do tend to google advice on things like how to get your baby to sleep, how much milk they should have, what type of car seat to use, and how long their naps should be, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the advice I tend to come across is a tangle of threads from reddit or Quora or some message board that I’d never heard of and will never hear of again. I told my friend about how everyone seems to have conflicting advice. Things their kid liked or benefited from that other kids didn’t. Except everyone on these threads was fully &lt;em&gt;confident&lt;/em&gt; it would work for most babies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend said: “I’ll give you some advice. There’s your baby. And then there’s the internet’s baby. And trust me, you don’t have the internet’s baby… no one wants the internet’s baby.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh. This could be applied to a lot of other google searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one wants the internet’s film collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one wants the internet’s car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one wants the internet’s diet or fitness regimen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want &lt;em&gt;our own&lt;/em&gt; stuff. We want to make our own decisions. We want the consequences of our choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can’t download knowledge from the internet, even if it feels like we can. We can only tell our story. And maybe it will help someone, but it won’t solve a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet contains a ridiculous amount of information and it’s constantly growing. But that makes it a flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick is figuring out, to use an outdated term, how to &lt;em&gt;surf&lt;/em&gt;. Surfers ride waves. They’re still in control. They’re &lt;em&gt;on top&lt;/em&gt; of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of us are inhaling salt water and clutching the internet’s baby, hoping we will make it to the shore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before becoming a parent, here’s a sample of some wisdom other parents tried to pass on to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you will never sleep again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you think a newborn exhausting? It gets worse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I feel like a shadow of my former self; everything is about my kids now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my options are narrower than before kids.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I regret the decision sometimes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having been a parent for a few months now, I can say that these are only true if you believe them going in. Chances are some well meaning person passed these very common “facts” on to these new parents and now they are attempting to pass them on to me. But I won’t believe them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;And it’s not because these pieces of advice lack truth, and it’s not as if 4 months of parenting has given me a full range of emotions, feelings, and lessons…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s because these little tid bits are almost impulsive. And they are contagious. Like any belief, it becomes much more real when you tell yourself it’s true. It’s how we lock into patterns as humans (and so can also be used to our benefit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve talked with so many parents about the job, and I’ve learned that the only “true” things people know about parenting are rooted &lt;em&gt;in their own experiences.&lt;/em&gt; Come to think of it, it couldn’t be any other way. I’ve also found that these blanket statements about parenting can change per person depending on when they are asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask a parent about the job after a family trip and you’re bound to get a much different response than after they’ve just watched their kid in a school musical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I can really extract from this is that the experience is vastly different from person to person: for every one of the negative statements above, I also heard the exact opposite at some point. Maybe there’s a duality to it. When you’re down, you’re really down. But when you’re up, it’s the greatest feeling. I’m familiar with this sentiment, having been a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way I handle these challenges is through robust systems. I determine my needs, and then I figure out the needs of my family and I try to automate processes either using my brain (a checklist of questions, a decision tree, etc) or using a computer/app if I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not perfect and never will be. Having a system in place (like GTD, but could be anything trustworthy) means that I can do things like move house, change jobs, and have kids, and I won’t be as easily overwhelmed as I would be without the systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s one other element. I once heard in a class on health that no diet or fitness regime will be sustained if it’s not done with joy. I think the same is true for parenting. Having joy doesn’t mean every moment will be easy or painless. But it does mean that the roots of your beliefs are in abundance instead of scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is joy even in chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write it on your hand.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Movie In Your Mind</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are some movies or TV shows that leave you with gruesome and vivid images. Images that leave you with nightmares for years. Shows like &lt;em&gt;Breaking Bad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are movies and shows that fill you up, that leave you more together than you were before. Movies where you remember the emotion you felt so clearly when you were in the theater. Films and shows like &lt;em&gt;Big Fish&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Six Feet Under&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But none of these images compare to the ones created by reading a well-written piece of fiction (a book).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Books are different. They are visual in a different way. Lucy Caulkins, who writes elementary curriculum, describes the effect of a good fiction book as “a movie in your mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the thing about movies in your mind is that they are created by your mind from mere words, and minds are fantastic screen directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well-written book is inherently more powerful than a well-directed show. Our brain knows us intimately, it knows what images scare us or bring us joy. A film director has to guess, and they’re often correct, but a well-written book is hardly ever wrong because our brain is the director, producer, and casting agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That kind of control over the visual elements of a story is unimaginable. The images created are individualized, specific to our own fears and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s harder work to read, of course, but for lovers of narrative… it’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Five Stars</title>

&lt;p&gt;So many services use the five star review. It’s an interesting way of judging work that you’ve consumed, and also an interesting way to compare work that you are thinking about consuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to look up one-star reviews of classic kids books, ones that are accepted as amazing, just to see what people would say in a one-star review of, say, &lt;em&gt;Goodnight Moon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But a number of stars can’t quite capture an experience. A five star review might make us think that the company being reviewed delivered their promise, a full experience, something magical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A one-star review might make us think that the experience was miserable, and that the buyer will never return for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until you look at the actual words of the review. Many of the one-star reviews of Goodnight Moon, for instance, are about quality control, not the actual story. Sometimes the book arrived later than the buyer thought it would, and thus, there’s a one-star review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the difference between a 3-star and 4-star review? Or a 2-star and 3-star review? In a 2-star review of a hotel, the three missing stars might be the thing that the buyer wanted desperately but the company couldn’t offer, something like a fancy free breakfast. And that thing might be small beans to another reviewer, who had a similar experience but gave the company 4 stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online reviews represent how much the product met the demands of the buyer (unless it’s consistent). And since everyone’s demands and needs are different, a product with a 2-star rating might be satisfactory for some, and might check all their boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the most life changing books and albums in my life have one-star reviews. I’m betting that some of your favorites do, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can judge a book by its cover, because we all do that. But don’t judge a book based on its review stars. You might miss something life changing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Timing Of Resolutions</title>

&lt;p&gt;In college, I remember making a New Years resolution to work out more at the gym. On Jan 2nd, I went to my university’s gym to find that not a single machine was vacant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Resolutions,” the front desk attendant muttered. “They’ll all be gone by February. Just watch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were. So was I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a young professional, I joined a gym in mid-January again, remembering my previous experience. I made a commitment to staying through until at least March.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;They were. So was I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a young professional, I joined a gym in mid-January again, remembering my previous experience. I made a commitment to staying through until at least March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Better to make a resolution in the summer,” my trainer told me. “That way, you don’t have as much of the pressure that seems to come with New Years resolution, and the gym will be quieter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found his logic sound and soon started resolving to make resolutions in the summer time only. Nothing really stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on, I’d read Charles Duhigg’s Power of Habits only to realize that making a resolution in general was meaningless; it was how one planned to change the habit loop that mattered. I could either change my cue/trigger, my routine, or my reward. Doing so would destroy my current loop and the habit would change naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, June or January, it didn’t matter much when I decided to change a habit or make a resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a key part to this that I breezed by a second ago, though: &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; have to make the change. &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; have to be able to do the work necessary to change a routine/reward/cue. And that takes patience. It takes a well-rested mind. And in June, most of us are busy with summer activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time of year, with most shops and restaurants closed until after New Years Day, the air outside is still and the neighborhood streets are silent. Most people are sleeping more than they usually do because most of society uses these two weeks as a built-in reprieve. Even if you work during this time, chances are it’s a bit slower than usual (unless you work in retail).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while habits can be changed anytime, they are much easier to change when time is slow. When you can spend time on adjustment. When details are visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to create a gym habit, start with when you have &lt;em&gt;nothing else going on&lt;/em&gt;. Make putting on your gym shoes your cue, and then the simple act of putting on gym shoes will lead to a full blown workout, which will lead to multiple workouts in a week, and eventually a habit that will result in weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is much harder to do when you’re in the middle of a busy work cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These last two weeks, the ones that close out the year, &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; in fact the best time for resolutions, but more importantly, they are the best time to start &lt;em&gt;acting&lt;/em&gt; on resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you see a window, jump through.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dear Future Self</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the course of my life, I’ve written a few letters to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first was for my college application. It asked the question: “Where do you see yourself in five years?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a very typical question, so I made sure give an atypical response. I wrote a letter to my past self from my future self, which allowed me to imagine what I would be like, what I might be thinking, or at least what I hoped to be thinking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Over the course of my life, I’ve written a few letters to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first was for my college application. It asked the question: “Where do you see yourself in five years?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a very typical question, so I made sure give an atypical response. I wrote a letter to my past self from my future self, which allowed me to imagine what I would be like, what I might be thinking, or at least what I hoped to be thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in teacher training, we were asked to write letters to ourselves often, and we’d be given the letters back in a few months to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I spend time each day journaling, and my journaling app allows me to see all the entries from this day going back for 7-8 years (I’ve been journaling daily for quite some time and have written about the process elsewhere).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a lot of introspection. It’s probably more than most people are used to. And it’s taught me a few lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, whether I was pretending to be my future self, or reading a letter as my future self written by my past-self, worry was a central theme of my writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my teacher program, I was worried about my upcoming honeymoon, which coincided with the first day of school. When I read the letter a few weeks later, I laughed because while I was still worried about things in my life, the honeymoon ended up being a pretty small deal. It made me feel less anxious about the current moment. Just having the knowledge that we won’t be worried about our current life events a few months from now isn’t enough – it helps to actually see this in action. The actual experience of this is what makes it so magical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, my writing is different when I read these letters. I always feel that I sound immature, even if the letter was written only a few months back. So I’m led to believe that my brain is constantly evolving. This is only one of the ways in which that change is visible in letters to self, and again, it’s much more helpful to experience this than it is to simply internalize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, and perhaps most important, I speak to my future-self in a very kind and loving manner. I tell myself not to worry, and that everything will be okay. I remind myself of the hard work I put in to my job every day. I congratulate myself once creative endeavors. It’s not how I speak to my present-self; that tends to be a little more harsh, sometimes insulting. And it’s &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; different from how I treat my past self, which is nearly abusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I wouldn’t be able to understand the ways in which I interact with my future and past self without this practice. We’re really never given any other opportunity or method to do this. It takes a little bit of planning, and perhaps a calendar reminder to remember to find your letter to self, but it’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did this with 3rd graders at the start of a school year, and gave them their letters back at the end of 4th grade. Most of the kids were so embarrassed by what they wrote, even though they didn’t share it with anyone else, that they ripped up their letters and threw the pieces into the trash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s okay. To destroy your past self, to push it away, is an act of moving on, as explosive as it may be. To look back and realize that you don’t even recognize the person you once were… it can be joyful, liberating even. And to look back and be thankful for the experiences you’ve had, to appreciate your flaws and fuck-ups… that’s joyful too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone should try to have the unique experience of writing a letter to their future self, and everyone should have the unique experience of reading a letter from their past self. Every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Do You Know Your Contexts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the last decade or so, I’ve use a productivity system called GTD. It’s a framework rather than an app or an instructive system, so my system has looked different over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind the system, at a basic level, is that you capture to-dos as they come, but process them later into appropriate lists that are then broken down into step-by-step tasks. Lists are then connected to “contexts” which are places/locations/tools needed to do work, so that when you sit down to work, you have a short list of items, all of which can be completed in one sitting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;For the last decade or so, I’ve use a productivity system called GTD. It’s a framework rather than an app or an instructive system, so my system has looked different over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind the system, at a basic level, is that you capture to-dos as they come, but process them later into appropriate lists that are then broken down into step-by-step tasks. Lists are then connected to “contexts” which are places/locations/tools needed to do work, so that when you sit down to work, you have a short list of items, all of which can be completed in one sitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went from a paper and pen system, to a stack of index cards known as the hipster PDA (this one lasted me about 5 years)… and eventually to the system I use now, which is an app called Omnifocus. The way you manage the system is dependent on the user and their needs of course, but having about ten years of experience with GTD, I can say that there’s one thing that has always tripped me up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is the idea of contexts. At first, I had two contexts. @Dorm and @Office (or @School when I was in college). Over time, I realized I needed an @studio and @car for creative tasks and errands, respectively. When I was a teacher, I used an @School context, but I also sub-contested in @PM and @AM, because certain to-dos were better to do in the morning (cognitive tasks, while my brain was still working) and some in the afternoon (like mindless copying, or simple grading).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re developing a productivity system, my suggestion is to look around your world and determine what contexts your life is divided into. Make a list of those and then sort tasks accordingly. You can create project lists in which each item is paired with a different context, so that you can execute on the project-based axis or the context-based axis (this is much easier to do with an electronic system since you can sort by metadata).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then… the key is simply to be aware of how your contexts are changing. As a freelancer who works remotely, I removed my @Office context from my system. I replaced it with tools – @iPhone, @Laptop and so on. This way if I’m on a particular device, I know exactly what could be accomplished. I still have an office space at home, but I pull up my @Laptop context for these sorts of sessions. If I’m out, waiting in a waiting room or something, I’ll pull up my @iPhone context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to feel free enough to change my contexts when needed. At first, they felt static, and it felt like if I changed any of them, I’d wreck my whole system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth is, understanding contexts and what can be accomplished within them is &lt;em&gt;key&lt;/em&gt; to a good productivity system, even if you only have one context.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Talk Or Space</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most overlooked things that new teachers forget about when they start teaching is how often kids cry. The instinct that arises when a new teacher sees a kid cry is to immediately figure out the cause so that they can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I was in a training once where this instinct was challenged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presenter said: “before you try to support or help someone, try asking them &lt;em&gt;what kind of support they need.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But I was in a training once where this instinct was challenged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presenter said: “before you try to support or help someone, try asking them &lt;em&gt;what kind of support they need.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a small thing but it blew my mind. By guessing how to help someone, I might unintentionally take away their power, take away their ability to learn, to reason, to solve. I can interfere with their processing of sadness or anger, two emotions that require a lot of independent practice to learn how to process, since the process is so different for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I developed a new response to anger and sadness from students when I noticed it. Instead of saying “what’s wrong?” I instead asked the question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you need to talk or do you need space?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which eventually just become “talk or space?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About half the time, the child would say “space” and I would do the very counterintuitive act of just walking away and allowing the child to deal on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best feeling was when the other students in my class started mimicking this. I’d overhear a girl saying to her friends “she wants space, let’s let her be, and she can join us when she’s ready.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if they said talk, I would let them talk as long as possible before saying anything. Often, they would come up with their own solution before I even opened my mouth. Compare that to a directive from an adult who’s had the experience to know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was my first real experience in empowering someone. Only I didn’t &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; anything. And this same framework can easily apply to adult situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes empowerment is as simple as asking “space or talk?” and then refraining from giving advice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Grocery Stores</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2018-12-27-on-grocery-stores/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the summers of my youth, when my sister and I were off from school, with no summer camps going on or any activities really, we used to accompany my mom to the grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember quite vividly how &lt;em&gt;frigid&lt;/em&gt; it was. How I wanted to leave the moment I got there. It was a unique feeling because while I generally disliked doing errands with my mom, the grocery store was a particular kind of hell for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;In the summers of my youth, when my sister and I were off from school, with no summer camps going on or any activities really, we used to accompany my mom to the grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember quite vividly how &lt;em&gt;frigid&lt;/em&gt; it was. How I wanted to leave the moment I got there. It was a unique feeling because while I generally disliked doing errands with my mom, the grocery store was a particular kind of hell for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a kid, the complaints were mostly around temperature and lack of things to do. At least at the mall, I could see different stores full of interesting things. I could hide under the clothing spinners. I could poke myself with push pins in the dressing room (putting the needles right under my epidermis so it didn’t hurt but looked cool).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hell, even going to the doctors was better. There were magazines and movies in the waiting room and one of those huge wired things with moveable rings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the grocery store was my most dreaded activity. And it’s even worse now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shopping carts are a great idea for containing groceries. But they’re huge and unwieldy. It’s easy to crash into a barrier or even another cart or person. At least it is for me, and the lack of maintenance on those carts sure doesn’t help. I’m always swinging back out of an aisle to let someone else pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to find anything, at least for me. Oh sure, 80% of my list is in places that are somewhat obvious: the produce is in the produce section, the cereal in the cereal aisle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about tahini? Is it in the international food aisle? Or the canned foods aisle? Why isn’t there a directory or index that can tell me? Why is it when I ask a store employee where the tahini is they have to ask someone else who has to call a manager?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tell you, I’ve spent hours in one aisle, my eyes darting back and forth among the jars and cans, trying to find fucking tahini. Maybe it’s just me, and I’m missing the spacial awareness needed to navigate such a store, but it’s irritating as hell. I’ve also sometimes seen green olives included only in a special corner along with cheese and crackers, just to be cute I guess. Not in the canned food aisle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will admit that those handheld scanners at giant that allow you to scan as you go are very useful and efficient. But that’s one store. How it’s not commonplace is beyond me. And of course services like Instacart and Peapod solve this issue, but even the few times I do visit a brick and mortar store ruin my mood and destroy my morale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’d be silly to complain without suggesting some solutions. Here are mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wider aisles. Yes the produce section &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; spacious but it’s actually a series of intersecting pathways that make crashes even more likely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organize everything alphabetically. I know I know, categories are useful. But what if we planned our trips ahead of time, what if it wasn’t about browsing the aisles? What if we alphabetized our shopping list so the grocery store trip was just a systematic experience? No friction at all. And maybe an index so we know that chickpeas are in the G aisle because they’re known as garbanzo beans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s make the world a better and more efficient place, starting with grocery stores.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>They Said My Kid Is Perfect</title>

&lt;p&gt;When my child was born, one of the most common comments I got from people was “he’s perfect.” It caught me off guard the first time because I’ve always believed that no one is perfect. Other new babies seem to get the same compliment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems an odd thing to say. Babies are people, and people aren’t perfect. I know that it’s kind of just something that people say about new babies, but then I realized that there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; some truth to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It seems an odd thing to say. Babies are people, and people aren’t perfect. I know that it’s kind of just something that people say about new babies, but then I realized that there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; some truth to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can drool all over themselves, blow out their diaper, keep you up till 5am, scream and cry the entire flight… and they will &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; be perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing: new babies are perfect because they haven’t hurt anyone yet. They haven’t used their words or actions to truly damage anyone’s spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dark side to “he’s perfect” is that one day, my son will be playing at daycare or something, and will get mad at another kid for something somewhat mild, and will hit them because he doesn’t know how to control anger yet. That other kid will cry. My kid will no longer be perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe he will have a sister and he will get angry that he’s not the only child anymore, and he will pull her hair so hard she cries for an hour. No longer perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe he will call someone a name randomly and impulsively and that name will stick with that person forever as a memory. The way that on the first day of kindergarten, I was made fun of for liking The Little Mermaid. I’ll never forget it. I was so hurt. Maybe he’ll do something like that, innocently because he doesn’t understand how restrictive gender norms can be (and how could he?). And then he will no longer be perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It happens to us all, that’s the reassurance. There are so many rites of passage we humans go through. First words, first steps, first day of school, first kiss… but nothing, &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;, is as life changing as the first time we hurt someone else. A switch gets pulled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that fateful day, whenever it comes, we will drop out of perfect heaven and rocket down to hurtful earth, alone with the residue of the pain we caused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s necessary. Because many years later, on one fine day, that small little life changing event will hopefully lead us to empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A parent can only hope.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rejected From Pandora</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2018-12-25-rejected-from-pandora/</link>

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I got a rejection notice from Pandora. I had submitted a new song months prior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s more to the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had always thought about submitting music to Pandora so that new listeners could find me. I figured that so many new artists are discovered on Pandora, so why not me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, I resisted the idea of submitting music to Pandora. I figured my tunes weren’t up to snuff yet – I was still learning as a songwriter and producer, and while my songs sounded fine to me, would they meet the mark of the music curators at Pandora?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I had always thought about submitting music to Pandora so that new listeners could find me. I figured that so many new artists are discovered on Pandora, so why not me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, I resisted the idea of submitting music to Pandora. I figured my tunes weren’t up to snuff yet – I was still learning as a songwriter and producer, and while my songs sounded fine to me, would they meet the mark of the music curators at Pandora?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, while I was working on my second studio album, a friend convinced me to try working with an experienced producer rather than self-producing. I went for it, and for one song that cost a little over a grand to make, I finally had a track that was approved by someone in the industry. And furthermore, this expert producer actually &lt;em&gt;liked&lt;/em&gt; the song. He even thought it had a place in the TV world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The song of mine that we recorded had been road tested and was a fan favorite. We got a professional drummer, and the producer layered tons of cool other instruments on top of my guitar and vocal. It also just meant a lot to me, lyrically and musically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I submitted. And about a few months later, I got an email that said something to the effect of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dear Artist,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After careful review of your submission, we have chosen not to include your song in our service. _We want to assure you that an actual person listened to the music._Please try again another time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like that they included that last part, just in case I wanted to reassure myself that a robot couldn’t identify the magic of my material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided I’d not try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And furthermore, I decided I wouldn’t try to convince gatekeepers that I was worth anything, because I’d end up feeling worthless. That’s part of the joy of creating in 2018 – we don’t need gatekeepers. Artists and bands in the 90’s sure needed record labels to promote their stuff and get played on the radio. JK Rowling definitely needed a publisher to make Harry Potter a hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But books like 50 Shades of Gray went directly to the market and thrived – it was only &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the success of the book that a publisher got interested. Same with OAR. Same with Chance the Rapper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get tweets and emails occasionally from well meaning people who ask me to submit my music to NPR’s Tiny Desk Concert. I respond with the same message every time: “Thanks for letting me know, but I don’t participate in competitions to get picked by a gatekeeper. I don’t want anyone to put a ranking on my art.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that’s more explanation than necessary, but I think it’s important for people to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I’ve lived by one mantra only: make art because it’s interesting to me, and then find people who will probably also find it interesting and see what happens. If 10 people dig a song, then that’s the reach of that song. And it’s &lt;em&gt;not nothing&lt;/em&gt;. Affecting 10 people is hard work, it requires insight and creativity and empathy. If a song had a radius of 100k people, great. But it doesn’t mean that my worth is multiplied by four – it just means, that for a particular piece, I was able to resonate with a larger cross-section of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you think about it, it’s the same for any artist, big or small. Sure, some artists have fame or momentum or trust on their side, which helps… but ultimately, if the work doesn’t resonate as widely as the last one did, then it doesn’t matter how many followers you have. The viral video I made in 2012 made me look like a superstar. The thing I found fascinating, it turns out, is also fascinating to a large portion of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the video I released after that, which was about tea and friendship, has 300 views. And the other hundreds of videos that came before the viral one have less than that. Sometimes work resonates in a big way. Sometimes it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what good is Pandora’s opinion?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Writing Is Thinking</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I heard a lecture recently for PHd students. The instructor started by informing the class in quite a dramatic fashion that they’ve never written a thing in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can that be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He went on to explain that they have been writing to an audience of one for years – a teacher – whose &lt;em&gt;job&lt;/em&gt; is to read their essay to &lt;em&gt;see what they know.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for any other piece of writing, he argued, this won’t be the case. For thoughts that are complex, a thinker &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; write their thoughts. The brain isn’t a big enough “table” to examine even slightly complex ideas. Did you ever think about that?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So, writing is thinking. But reading, he says, is meant to change the the way a reader sees the world (unlike the reason your college professor read your work). So by using writing to think, we are interfering with the reading process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would add to this that sometimes writing is thinking and reading is reflection – if the writer is the same person as the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write a lot, and for different purposes. Since the talk I watched was for PHds, this post is about writing as thinking with some wider applications. This is my strategy;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I journal daily in an app called DayOne. You can create multiple journals and tag entries. I even print books of my entries since the app allows me to do that. I find that this type of writing ends up being mostly bulleted lists of events of the day and how I was feeling. Occasionally I’ll post a photo if it’s meaningful. I have 7 years of this type of writing, more if you count my childhood journals. The audience is me and maybe kids and great grandkids one day who find my work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I write this blog daily. I don’t really promote it, and there are a few different themes that are a bit scattered but right for my life. Creativity, technology, psychology, and spirituality, I would say. I don’t have a target audience though it isn’t purely for me – if one of my 365 blog posts a year provides value to someone else, just one time, I’ve done my job. And in order to do that, I publish every day like a fisherman goes fishing. Doesn’t matter if my entry doesn’t resonate every time because the ones that resonate wouldn’t happen without the daily habit (because I’d only write when I felt like it, which would reduce the amount of at-bats I’d have). Plus, if writing is thinking, then I can justifiably say that I think deeply about subjects that interest me each day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I write my book on education every day. This is more structured, more argumentative writing. This is to provide value to the customers I serve as an education and technology expert. I write books in an app called Ulysses which allows me to write in a modular way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I collect ideas in an app called drafts throughout the day. Just when it occurs to me. These are just little notes that will become blog posts or chapters or songs or podcasts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I write what I call paraphernalia in Evernote, which is a popular note taking app. Grocery lists, where I parked, notes to talk about at therapy. Anything that doesn’t fit into an above category tends to go here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing is thinking. I feel like as introvert there a lot of buckets in which to place my thoughts and develop ideas. Ideas that might provide value to you or just me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if that isn’t the point of living, to provide value… what is?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last year and a half, I changed careers, became a father, and bought a house with my wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these experiences went pretty smoothly. My child is healthy and exceedingly happy. The house is perfect for us right now, and my job is flexible, rewarding, and fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wake up and think: _I am so lucky to live this life._And then right after that, I also wonder how it’s possible to be so lucky (beyond the “luck” I have from being privileged in many ways, that is). Surely this type of joy doesn’t come without a cost. Is there some kind tragedy lurking around the corner, and this luckiness is actually deception? Is the other shoe going to fall?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;In the last year and a half, I changed careers, became a father, and bought a house with my wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these experiences went pretty smoothly. My child is healthy and exceedingly happy. The house is perfect for us right now, and my job is flexible, rewarding, and fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wake up and think: _I am so lucky to live this life._And then right after that, I also wonder how it’s possible to be so lucky (beyond the “luck” I have from being privileged in many ways, that is). Surely this type of joy doesn’t come without a cost. Is there some kind tragedy lurking around the corner, and this luckiness is actually deception? Is the other shoe going to fall?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I feel like I don’t deserve it. It makes me stressed during moments where I should probably feel gratitude and joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember all of the communication struggles and the resulting systems that built my marriage. I remember the pain of every misunderstanding in the beginning, the years of trial, error, forgiveness, and heart break. In a long relationship, it’s like having many mini-relationships over time due to how much you change as people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember being dissatisfied for six years at a job that wasn’t right for me. I remember crying trying to decide what to do next. I remember trusting my intuition and going against the grain to become a teacher. And I remember the half year of pain in detaching from my teaching career. Of ending something I dearly loved but couldn’t continue to do in that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember wanting to trust that the initial feeling we had about our house was the right one. And how that complete trust in our intuition was what it took to make the leap and put down the money needed to buy property. I remember moving every box by hand, in the middle of the night, by myself because my wife was pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the work it took to even be in the right place to have a kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember. It wasn’t luck. It was work. On top of a foundation of privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s true that this type of joy doesn’t come without a cost. There were &lt;em&gt;numerous costs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, it’s life, so it’s not without balance. It’s like joy and tragedy are mirror images; not two captains but two boatmen, rowing the boat with a double-sided paddle from opposite sides. When one paddle is in the water, the other is in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s this phenomenon that we refer to as luck. When the paddle is up, it feels like we didn’t ever have to work for it. And when the paddle is in the water, it feels like we will never make it out alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But row on, we must.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I Wish For Nuance</title>

&lt;p&gt;This holiday season, I wish for nuance. If I could give each person a gift, it’d be nuance wrapped in a bow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish for nuance in our news headlines. Our diets and workout plans. Our political stances. Our religions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish for nuance in yoga, nuance in justice, nuance in movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuance: that little pause, that deepening, that recognition of the difference between grey and taupe. Between a globe and an earth themed beach ball.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Nuance: that little pause, that deepening, that recognition of the difference between grey and taupe. Between a globe and an earth themed beach ball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the definition of nuance is poetry: a shade of difference in meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuance in social media, that would be great. After all, news was still social before social media, but the information you get from a face to face conversation is just so much more rich than the information you get from a back and forth Facebook row. More rich and less stained. Even the most subtle non-verbal cues give us so much more than emojis ever will. (Webcams don’t even do it justice; there is magic and data in three dimensions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuance has become antithetical to the way we process and share information in 2018. To the way we develop and defend our opinions. Emojis and gifs and huge white text over pictures… these devices have taken our worldview hostage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in this hostage scenario, nuance is the hero, the negotiator, and forensics all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s how we got to this splintered and divided world we live in. The same machine that gave us media personalization (news meant to confirm our biases) is the same machine that took away our ability to let other perspectives change how we see reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bringing nuance back will take hard work, time, patience, and a willingness to step away from Facebook and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it may be our last chance at scraping our way out of the maze.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the end of the year, many people on social media ask for podcast, music and book recommendations. There are top 10 lists galore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I help out, I make my recommendations, but no one ever checks them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movie recommendations are easier of course, because the selection of available movies to watch is much more limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the internet and niche culture has made it so the podcasts and music and books I really love appeal to me and my geeky communities, but not to everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But the internet and niche culture has made it so the podcasts and music and books I really love appeal to me and my geeky communities, but not to everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one else that I know personally listens to a 90 minute podcast about productivity on the Mac, for instance. Yet these podcasts are &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; in the world of the people that share my particular form of geekery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assume what people are looking for in random top 10 lists are the mainstream material, the Serials, the Ariana Grandes. And friend to friend recommendations are important, but everyone is part of different communities with different micro interests. Most of my friendships are built on shared experiences. The overlapping communities are just a coincidental perk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And perhaps people are hoping to find an overlap by scouting through lists. I’ve certainly done this. But it’s a bit like spelunking; you might come up empty handed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I also have friendships that exist &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; we live in the same geeky universes. Because we both love pens, or macs, or OmniFocus, or productivity, or folk music, or magic. And those recommendations are gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the question is: should we seek out the work that &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; has been listening to? Should we go for whatever is #1 on the charts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or do we think about what makes us unique and then find the work that was made specifically for people like us?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Turbulence</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the first airplane trips I can remember was when I was eight. We were going to Pakistan, by way of London, which would mean I’d get to see my cousins in the UK for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I counted down the days until the flight and was so excited to fly for a long period of time. I snuggled deep into blankets and watched movies (on one huge screen at the front of the airplane), and I was disappointed when it was over.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I counted down the days until the flight and was so excited to fly for a long period of time. I snuggled deep into blankets and watched movies (on one huge screen at the front of the airplane), and I was disappointed when it was over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in 2007, I started traveling every week for work. It never really bothered me, the travel. It was kind of fun, and I was racking up VIP points on airlines and hotels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we took a flight to Malaysia in 2012. I remember that there was intense turbulence for three hours. And ever since that flight, I get terrified of flying. If the plane moves ever so slightly, or bumps for a few minutes, I get nervous, stop whatever I’m doing and try to control the plane with my mind to prevent it from crashing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It got to the point where I had to take an online fear of flying course. The course taught me two things that made me feel much better:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’ve ever put your hand out of the car window on a hot day, you’ve probably noticed that you can kind of do this wave motion with your hand and the air will feel kind of thick. That’s because the car is moving so fast that the air actually becomes thicker around it. The same thing happens on a plane, but the plane is moving even faster than the car. The effect is that the air outside of a plane is like jello, and the plane itself is like a little plastic figurine stuck in that jello. So you won’t fall out of the sky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turbulence does not cause airplane crashes, faulty equipment does. And every piece of equipment has 2 or 3 backups on an airplane. Most pilots have never had to activate even one of these backup systems in decades of flying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I’ve recovered a bit from my phobia of airplanes. Now, when turbulence happens, I just keep repeating this mantra:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’re safe, you’re safe, you’re safe. This is a nuisance, but you’re safe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I smile to myself. I think about all the fun activities I’ll do when I’m off the plane. It gets me through. And most times, even for the rocky flights, I don’t remember them much afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That feeling of going through something turbulent but safe is something that has now transferred to other pain points in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a classroom teacher, and the class got out of control occasionally, I’d repeat… &lt;em&gt;this is a nuisance, but you’re safe.&lt;/em&gt; And it would keep me from escalating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my son is sick and I’m on my last bar of human battery life, I repeat to myself… &lt;em&gt;this is a nuisance, but you’re safe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That amygdala, that lizard brain, gets activated during any kind of turbulence. And it takes all the strength I have to use my mantra to activate the front of my brain, the part that soothes the lizard, or at least puts it in a cage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a nuisance, but I’m safe.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Good Ol Days</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was sitting with someone recently at a work event, and I was talking about my newborn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Enjoy it,” he told me. “I wish I had. I was so stressed about everything when my daughter was born. Now I realize, those were the good ol’ days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It happened again, around the same time. My wife and I were singing to our son and a relative who was staying with us said: “Ah, how wonderful. You’ll remember these as the good ol’ days.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It happened again, around the same time. My wife and I were singing to our son and a relative who was staying with us said: “Ah, how wonderful. You’ll remember these as the good ol’ days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good ol’ days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trying to place why this didn’t sound totally new. And I realized that &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the baby was born, when my wife was pregnant, people would often say: “Ah, enjoy the quiet house, and the time you can spend with your spouse. You’ll think of these as the good ol’ days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And before that, come to think of it, before my wife was even pregnant, at our wedding, when we were just talking about possible kids one day, friends would say: “Well, enjoy your time together as a couple. Some day you’ll have kids, and these will be the good ol’ days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man, and I remember in college, when we took our first writing class, and the teacher was explaining how the writing we would do in this class would only affect us and no one else, and how that would &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; be the case in the professional world. And so he said: “Think of these as the good ol’ days. When you’re writing for an audience of one, me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I remember being upset about the batteries on my game boy not working for about 20 minutes on a car trip once, and my dad turned to my uncle and said, “man, kids. They make such a big deal about the smallest things. They have no idea what’s to come. They don’t know that they’ll look back on these years as the good ol’ days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So at every single important moment in my life, someone has pointed out that I’ll look back on the present one day wistfully. I’ll bet I’m not the only one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it makes us feel nice in the moment, but the build up of these kind of statements over time can be toxic. Dangerous even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we’re so focused on how stressed and overloaded our future self will be as they review the past. We’re concerned that the future self will wish they had been more appreciative of what our past-self had. We assume that it won’t slow down, won’t get better, that there won’t ever be a moment of rest, of relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe we’re right, but all this interplay between time and perspective makes us miss the point entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That this kind of thinking puts an intense focus on the past and the future, but completely ignores the present moment. That the good ol’ days are right &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; and will always be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joy and tragedy will come and go. Things &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; get more complex over time, most likely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unless we stay in the present moment, unless we subscribe to the idea that there are good ol’ days happening right now on our journey, then we never actually get to appreciate how good these days really are.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Second Verse And A Bridge</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2018-12-18-a-second-verse-and-a-bridge/</link>

&lt;p&gt;Many songwriters know this feeling. You write a great song, and you call it a song even though you still need to write a second verse and a bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the thing is, the second verse and bridge are &lt;em&gt;infinitely&lt;/em&gt; harder to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent 10 mins on a first verse and chorus before. Any lay person would be fooled into thinking the song was complete. And I’ve then spent years thinking about a second verse and bridge. Never playing the song live or recording it. It just exists when I’m alone with my guitar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Never playing the song live or recording it. It just exists when I’m alone with my guitar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s because saying something somewhat original is not too hard, and that’s what the first verse and chorus offer. Yes, that’s difficult too sometimes, but not nearly as complicated. Writing a second verse requires an examination of the same idea but with a new take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a bridge? Oh you know, just the effort needed to transcend all the lyrics in the rest of the song to tie it all together in a perfectly soul moving opus. This, by the way, is why songs with good bridges just end up being better songs in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d compare writing the first verse and chorus to laying down the puzzle pieces. Seeing what the larger picture might be and laying down the outer edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second verse (or third, or fourth…) is filling in the gaps. It’s trying pieces until they fit, examining the images on those pieces, making sure there is cohesion in the piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the bridge is figuring out the perfect place to frame and hang the completed puzzle. It’s the life, the soul, the heart because it turns a puzzle from a bunch of interlocking pieces to a profound and complete thought. Yes, you can have a great song without a thoughtful bridge but it won’t be an &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt; song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I knock all these steps out in 15 minutes and other times it’s years. I find that the less time I put in between completed songs, the quicker it goes when I do write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process is deceivingly hard. But all songwriters forget this the minute their instrument is in their hand, their notebook open for lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that moment, it seems easy every time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A sign in a Minneapolis parking garage simply says “watch and wait.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The context of course is that people might be walking by, and we don’t want them to get hit by cars… so watch and wait, and then exit safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I love taking signs like these out of context and thinking about how they might apply to other parts of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, when I became a parent, a piece of advice I was given was: whatever new parent stuff you’re anxious about, you won’t be anxious about it in two weeks. But you’ll be anxious about something else. Watch and wait.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Or when I get really upset about a current life situation, my wife always says to me: &lt;em&gt;this too shall pass.&lt;/em&gt; And it helps. Watch and wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be clear: I don’t believe we should spend our lives just watching and waiting. There’s an unspoken third step: decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, not to &lt;em&gt;act&lt;/em&gt;, necessarily, just to &lt;em&gt;decide&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I decide to let go of whatever I am watching and waiting. It’s a simple but conscious decision and it provides finality to what could be an endless loop of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I decide to ponder more. Another simple decision that defers my thinking to a later time, when I can write out a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And other times, I decide to act right away. This used to be my default, and in fact it was the only way I knew how to proceed. It didn’t always work out, understandably. Sometimes pondering or letting go would have been better choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But regardless of what decisions I make, the first two steps always remain the same: watch and wait.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What We Want From Meditation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was fifteen, I developed an interest in Zen Buddhism. The practice of &lt;em&gt;zazen&lt;/em&gt; in particular drew me in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen is a tangled web of rage and depression (at least it was for me) so the idea that a daily practice of sitting (the direct translation of zazen) appealed to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules, at least according to the Buddhist philosophers, were relatively straight forward. You sit. You acknowledge thoughts when they arise but you don’t judge them. And that’s it. You trust that this daily repetition will have long term effects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The first time I tried it, it felt like I was doing it wrong. I wasn’t, but it felt that way, and I couldn’t understand why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, mediation has become quite trendy. Westerners pay a lot of money for yoga sessions that touch on the idea of meditation but don’t quite get to the heart of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, I once went to a yoga class where the instructor told us to meditate on a thought during each pose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meditate on a thought? Wasn’t that the opposite of what zazen taught us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there are the apps. Many apps that walk people through a “guided meditation.” There are sounds of nature, calming words, and step by step instructions. I guess it’s a bit like having a coach in the gym, talk you through the routines as you’re doing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it runs contrary to the idea of Zazen. And not that there couldn’t be two different interpretations of what it means to meditate, it’s just… why would I want a voice other than my own buzzing in my ear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn’t the goal to manage &lt;em&gt;your own&lt;/em&gt; inner voice? How much harder does it get, and how much of its usefulness is lost, when another voice joins in, even if the step-by-step is helpful for a beginner?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see Zazen not as a calming ritual, but as a practice for daily life. The idea is that if I can practice acknowledging but not grasping onto my feelings too hard, I could get better at doing it when I’m &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; sitting on the zafu (meditation cushion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if that can happen with the apps, or with guided mediation. If it’s not just me, my mind, and the sounds of the room, can I effectively gain this skill to be used out in the real world? Or would I need to plug in some earbuds if a particular event triggered me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me back to the idea of feeling like I’m not doing it right. Despite all that the apps remove from the experience, they give people the feeling that they’re &lt;em&gt;doing it right&lt;/em&gt;. And I think that’s what many people want from meditation – to feel that they did it right, not necessarily to experience the benefit of mindful living in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the question of whether or not it’s working can’t be answered until a steady and daily practice has been built. You’ll know you did it right when your brain can jump right into mindfulness whenever you choose. Or at least, you’re better at it than you were before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for the Buddhist monks, that’s all the time. Cushion or not. Grocery store or monastery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they call it enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>T Pains Map</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, the artist T-pain released an NPR Tiny Desk &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/CIjXUg1s5gc&#34;&gt;Concert&lt;/a&gt; without &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; processing from Auto Tune on his voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antares Autotune, as the name suggests, is the infamous software used to fix off pitch vocals after recording. It was designed to be a touch up tool. If the software did its job, the listener wouldn’t know that any extra tool was being used – and the artist would sound perfectly on pitch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, the artist T-pain released an NPR Tiny Desk &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/CIjXUg1s5gc&#34;&gt;Concert&lt;/a&gt; without &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; processing from Auto Tune on his voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antares Autotune, as the name suggests, is the infamous software used to fix off pitch vocals after recording. It was designed to be a touch up tool. If the software did its job, the listener wouldn’t know that any extra tool was being used – and the artist would sound perfectly on pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except that’s not how T-Pain used it. T-Pain had made an art of using the software to tune his notes so perfectly that it sounds half-robotic. He became known it for it. And other artists like Kanye on his Heartbreaks and 808s album, started following suit. Bon Iver made autotune a focus of his sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many artists, like Imogen Heap, had innovated and done something similar with tuned vocals before T-pain, but T-Pain was the artist made it popular, a mainstay sound in modern RnB and eventually pop music (and eventually indie rock too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when this Tiny Desk was released with &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; autotune on his voice, people understandably freaked. Not only did he drop the computerized vocal sound, but his natural voice was… &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. And not just kind of good, but… excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, the commenters asked, was he hiding such a raw talent? Why hide behind “studio magic” when you have real skill?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because autotune is a tool for vocalists. And with every great tool, there are those practitioners who can manipulate it, bend it to their will, and then there are those who take the easy way, and follow the map innovators created by way of their art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T-Pain, being a great vocalist already, had the skills in place to bend AT to his will. Not just anyone could do what he did, not in a captivating way at least. For most of his disciples (official and unofficial), AT remained a way to turn bad singing into something passable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For T-Pain, it was a way to mold the greatness he already possessed. He was becoming an innovator and musical leader in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For everyone else, it became a norm, and the innovative technique led to boring art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keller Williams led the way with live looping (Les Paul too). Led Zepplin did it with amped violins. Eno with ambient music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with a map is that it means someone already walked the path. Most people don’t want to explore uncharted territory, but that’s what it takes to be an innovator.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Texture Of My Brain</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my in-laws once said that therapy isn’t akin to cleaning out your attic; rather, it’s like turning on a light. It always intrigued me, and I believe in proactive and preventative care, so I promised myself I’d try it if I could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months, I’ve walked away from each of my therapy sessions with a new insight. A new piece of info about how my brain works, about how I communicate. About how others in my life communicate, and how I can tune into this to be more harmonious with them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few months, I’ve walked away from each of my therapy sessions with a new insight. A new piece of info about how my brain works, about how I communicate. About how others in my life communicate, and how I can tune into this to be more harmonious with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’ve since revised the original simile. It’s a light in the attic, sure, but it is more like my brain is a maze. There are fears, worries, bullies from the past around ever corner. There is also joy, hope, and every warm hug I’ve ever received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapy is like me walking blindfolded along the inside walls of this maze and my therapist is letting me know there’s a wall coming up. She’s letting me know how to feel the sidewalls for vines and how to sense potholes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s teaching me how to navigate, something that no one else, not even a close friend can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Talk to someone” is a common way of telling someone to find a therapist, to imply they have yet to understand the structure and texture of their own walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not as easy as talking. If it were, therapy could be a coffee date with a friend. Which helps me make decisions and feel grounded, but it doesn’t give me a navigation tool for the maze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That navigation tool, by the way, isn’t a map. I can’t see what’s coming. It’s more like a training on the textures of my mind. By knowing how the walls feel, and knowing what that means, I can find my way just a bit easier.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Stargazing Can Teach Us</title>

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I started advertising my services as a professional magician around the holidays. The idea was that I’d perform at holiday parties to small groups of adults while they talked, ate, and drank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I booked my first gig and found out there was a miscommunication (or perhaps a non-communication) and instead of walking around doing tricks for adults, I was going to be at a table performing tricks for children. This wasn’t the worst news; I had spent years as an elementary school teacher, so I was used to working with and performing for kids.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So I booked my first gig and found out there was a miscommunication (or perhaps a non-communication) and instead of walking around doing tricks for adults, I was going to be at a table performing tricks for children. This wasn’t the worst news; I had spent years as an elementary school teacher, so I was used to working with and performing for kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it made me think, as many situations tend to do. It was assumed that as a magician, I’d be performing for kids. In fact, whenever I perform for the children of friends, the adults tend to tune out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A magic trick, in their mind, is the equivalent of a balloon animal. Delightful for the young, but useless for the old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve written about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ziahassan.com/daily/magic-is-a-gift/&#34;&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; before. I see it as a gift, an opportunity to escape the chains of the “real world” for a moment. To experience something surreal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most adults don’t see it this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the balloon animal though, a magic trick gives an adult access to the child within them. We live in a world of daily routine, of 9-5, of soccer practice, of yearly traditions, of family dinners, of Netflix sitcoms, and of political theater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And honestly, maybe the same goes for the balloon animal. Maybe the same goes for Saturday morning cartoons, and fruit loops, and summer camps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the same goes for long road trips where you fall asleep listening to the same 12 songs on your discman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same goes for coloring books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult coloring books were a popular holiday gift a few years ago. Up until then, we hadn’t thought of “coloring” as an adult activity – but some marketers came along and changed our perception. It wasn’t as if the activity itself was inherently childish, no, it was that the activity was &lt;em&gt;associated&lt;/em&gt; with children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t love the feeling of not knowing how something works, magic can sometimes be unsatisfying. And this is how many adults operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except that we &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; know how everything works, we just convince ourselves we do. The only difference is that with magic, the mystery is intentional. It’s administered by a professional wonder-smith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you look at a stars, are you picturing unromantic giant balls of gas? Do you know the intricate details of the math and science that brought you this incredible view for stargazing? Do you &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or are you simply in awe of its beauty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the song asks, “what’s so amazing that keeps us stargazing?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, to gaze is to be in awe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kids, on the other hand, don’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to know how everything works. They don’t care. What’s important to them is how an experience makes them feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while we can’t operate in that mode all the time, there’s room for it in our lives if we allow it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Magic Of An Old Guitar</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine came over recently and was playing some of my guitars (I have 8 of them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He picked up a vintage acoustic, one from the 70s that I had picked up used on eBay a few years ago, and examined it closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ew! The neck of this guitar is &lt;em&gt;covered&lt;/em&gt; in dead skin cells. Want me to try to clean this off for you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had noticed that the neck was a bit gross looking, but hadn’t realized that what I was looking at was literally the skin cells of the player(s) who used this guitar before me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I had noticed that the neck was a bit gross looking, but hadn’t realized that what I was looking at was literally the skin cells of the player(s) who used this guitar before me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross. And yet…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s something special about an instrument that has been previously owned and played, particularly a guitar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guitar has been a conduit for so many stories. So many emotions that couldn’t be expressed in mere words or with a simple memo. So many characters and settings. So much frustration, joy, and wonder have vibrated through its spruce top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all those stories, like pieces of fruit in a juicer, leave marks behind. Residue of life, stories, music, soul. Units of residue. Cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I pick up the guitar, my palms rub against that rough coating on the back of the neck (though my friend did try to clean it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I hear the essence of those stories, of those melodies. I hear the essence of all the heartbreak and repair and curiosity and joy that went into someone’s art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’m inspired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now when I play my modern guitars, I press a little harder with my palms on the back of the neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To pay it forward to the next owner, years from now, trying to bare their soul through wood and steel.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Singing To A Mirror</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Songwriting is reflective by its very nature. Writing lyrics is a kind of therapy, of course. But how those lyrics are presented, the texture of the music, the sentiment of the chord changes, the choice of instruments… all of these artistic choices are part of a reflective process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because when artists look inward, we’re sometimes confronted with stuff we’d rather not acknowledge. Other times, it’s stuff we were actually searching for, like an understanding of why we feel what we feel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;And other times we write about stuff that hasn’t happened yet. It’s a phenomenon that always baffles me, but I sometimes write a song that sounds and looks great but has no connection to my life until a few months later, when something happens and the song suddenly makes total sense. It’s a type of clairvoyance that I’ve never experienced outside of writing music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I upped my game quite a bit when I moved into an apartment with a huge bathroom back in 2011. Huge bathrooms mean great acoustics, so it was the perfect place to sing and record ideas into my phone. But along with a huge bathroom came a huge mirror. And suddenly I could see myself as I was generating ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And weirdly, it helped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My face and body language, I discovered, are incredible feedback machines. Generally, if I write in front of a mirror I make a better song. I can’t pin point the exact moment where the mirror helps me make good musical choices, but I can feel it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sing words, and my face tells me which word needs to change as I sing it. My reflection is unsure, like trying a new food for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the song can’t be improved, my reflection is confident, overjoyed even. Like being wrapped in a blanket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learn more and more about what it means to reflect every time I pick up an instrument or sing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was a literal mirror that taught me the most.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Malaysian Toilets Cultural Orientation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was giving a demonstration of a piece of software that reads text aloud in various languages. To show it off, I set up a text document comprised of the same sentence but written in a number of different languages. As the software read out loud, it highlighted each individual word as it said it. Eventually it got to the Arabic section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It reads it backward!” I shouted over the reading, to emphasize the point that the software tracked the words from right to left, instead of the usual left to right of the other languages in the document.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I immediately knew what I said was incorrect – the text was not being read backward, it was read the correct way, which just happened to be different from what I’m used to in the western world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times have I thought something was weird or backward when it was merely culturally different from what I’m used to? How many things have I labeled as “weird” simply because it didn’t fit &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; construct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember how weird it was seeing this sign in Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s often featured on blog lists about the world’s strangest signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weird! Why would there be a sign to not step on a toilet? Isn’t that common sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It becomes a bit clearer when you visit Malaysia and understand that many bathrooms don’t even have a toilet – just a hole in the ground, and a hose. Bathroom goers squat above the hole to do their thing, and flush with the hose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone encountering a western style toilet for the first time after living this way would probably try to stand on it – just as I tried to “sit” on the hole in the ground at a rest stop in the Malaysian country side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are foot marks all over those western style toilets in Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because to Malaysians, the idea of &lt;em&gt;sitting&lt;/em&gt; on a porcelain bowl is what’s weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a common procedure at funerals to talk about the deceased’s life, and the ways in which the deceased changed the lives of others. People will give these kind of speeches, or write these kind of social media posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I hear these speeches and I think, these are some of the kindest words I’ve ever heard about a person. If they were alive, they would feel pretty damn special and loved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I hear these speeches and I think, these are some of the kindest words I’ve ever heard about a person. If they were alive, they would feel pretty damn special and loved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another feature of these types of speeches is that the speaker expresses regret for not having said this to their friend or family members when they were still alive. Sometimes the regret is palpable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, a lot of thought went into the words chosen for these tributes. More than usual it’s because we want to tie a &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt; knot on a person’s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about birthdays, when our friends a and family are still alive and celebrating? What do we say about them then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HBD! Hope your birthday is great.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s Jimmy’s birthday today, he is the best!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s almost as if on birthdays, when our loved ones still exist, we do the opposite of funeral tributes; we put very little thought and care into our words celebrating them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because those words at a funeral are for us. To see someone as the best possible person, to look at their flaws as gifts, to feel grateful that they stopped by on this crazy journey of life. It’s language used to mourn and grieve. It helps us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on a birthday, when they are still alive, the words are for them. And that’s harder because it is &lt;em&gt;so hard for people to be vulnerable and say how they feel to people that are alive&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had someone gush about you with very well crafted language? It can be as awkward as it is sweet. But in death, when it’s one sided, it’s somehow not only easier but natural to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose that we think about how we use that type of language to comfort ourselves when we are grieving and use it to lift our friends and family up when they are still alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write like they aren’t there anymore. Tell them about the immense value they bring to the universe. Tell them &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; it becomes about you, and your grief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miss them before they’ve left.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s an old trope that when a man buys a new product, they completely ignore the manual and try to assemble or use the product just by intuition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently saw someone on Facebook post about the 25 page manual for their toothbrush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a humidifier recently that came with instructions but no diagrams. The result was that I ended up frying the circuitry in the base by overfilling it (I didn’t realize where the fill line was located, and it was in an awkward place).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, that word, &lt;em&gt;manual&lt;/em&gt; is also the word used to describe a piece of technology that is not &lt;em&gt;automatic&lt;/em&gt;. Manual requires a little bit of skill, a little bit of know-how. It requires mindfulness. These are things that the manual grants us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It grants us know-how and skill by giving us important information about our new technology. How the buttons work, applications, configurations. Things that we wouldn’t know by intuition alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it also grants us mindfulness via a pause. We pause before we start to open the rest of the package. We get an understanding before we dive in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life can be this way too. Perhaps I spend years reading about diving before trying it. Or perhaps I jump into my pool head first and see what happens. Both experiences provide learning in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the question is: what type of learning do you want for any given experience? Do you want to pause and understand, or just dive in?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>As Time Goes By For A Bird</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was 12, my parents got an African grey parrot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, we just wanted Coco to talk, because that is what we understood parrots do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we talked to him, sang to him, whistled to him. At first he just squawked a lot, but after some time, he developed a repertoire of sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad farting, the sound of someone peeing, and eventually “here Coco bird, I love you.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;My dad farting, the sound of someone peeing, and eventually “here Coco bird, I love you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bought him in Egypt and my sister and I were middle schoolers. He moved with us back to the states in 1999 (after a huge battle to get him out of Egypt). We call him a him because we never got genetic testing done to determine his sex. We just assume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s seen me grow from age 12 to nearly 34, from the same vantage point mostly. Though there was this one time I came home from school to find him missing from his cage. He had somehow flown inside our piano. I still have no idea how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom has sung him an adapted version of Goodnight Irene for about 20 years now. He can whistle the tune, and often does right before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad used to whistle As Time Goes By. Coco still whistles this tune, constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;You must remember this:&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;A kiss is still a kiss,&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;A sigh is just a sigh.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;The fundamental things apply&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;As time goes by.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s fitting. As an African Grey, he has many more years ahead of him. Many more years of, well, this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He never goes out. Never goes for a walk. He just sits on his perch, in the corner of our living room, whistling and watching… as time goes by.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Layers In Cash Transfer Apps</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was explaining Venmo/Cash transfer apps to a person who is firmly part of the generation above me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So you can see people’s transactions?” he asked me, wide-eyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, but you can’t see how much the transaction was,” I told him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So what’s the point?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the point? For years, PayPal allowed people to transfer money to each other. Why did Venmo and Cash become everyone’s first choice over PayPal?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the point? For years, PayPal allowed people to transfer money to each other. Why did Venmo and Cash become everyone’s first choice over PayPal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because these apps offer two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A quick way to transfer money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A status signal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PayPal actually used to (and still does) pride themselves for being the “secure” platform. No one would ever gain access to your transactional data, they promised. And other than some rate breaches, they kept this promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Venmo and Cash make that part of the experience. Who you hang out with speaks volumes about you, especially if you’re part of a wider community. And, just like on Instagram and Facebook, enjoy showing off who we’re hanging out with, especially if they’re well respected in our community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when people use Cash and Venmo, friends might see a transaction and be impressed that you had “dinner and drinks” with someone high status. Or that they are so close to you that they leant you money! Or that you do business with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the opposite of PayPal’s model, yet it wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll give up a piece of our lives that used to be private to get more chances to show our status.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A List Of Things That Worked</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2018-12-05-a-list-of-things-that-worked/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lists should be a part of every person’s toolset, when trying to solve a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just to-do or task lists. Any set of items that are woven together by a common thread counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, it helps to forget about the to-do list and create a “to-done” list. Instead of writing down what you &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to do, you write done what you’ve already done that was successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use this with my newborn (who is almost out of newborn status). Any time I do some weird action that causes him to sleep better, or be less fussy, I write it down. When I am totally depleted, I turn to this list. If the same action doesn’t work twice because he’s changed, or because it was a fluke… I cross it off the list.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, this doesn’t seem like an actual solution. After all, the techniques on the list either work or they don’t, and sometimes it’s hard to tell if something that worked once will ever work again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But writing is thinking. I can think deeply in my head about how to manage my child and fight a battle each day when it comes time to take action, or I can use a tool like a list to sort through all of the different widgets I could crank to achieve the goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe that’s why a list is full of magic. The list (any list) transforms large, complex ideas into achievable, do-able, crankable widgets (as David Allen puts it). It turns the waterfall into bottled water, and it makes a room of books turn into a library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once you’ve got widgets, anyone can crank those. The list becomes a flyswatter, a ladle, a spatula, a sifter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Certainty To A Beat</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m certain that I’ll see sunlight when daybreak hits, even if it’s filtered through clouds. This makes me feel safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m uncertain whether or not my presentation will go well. This makes me feel tense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m certain that in one hour, it will be 9:43. It would completely and absolutely surreal if this didn’t happen. Safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m uncertain that I’ll be on time for my flight because of the traffic. Tense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;All day long, all week long, all &lt;em&gt;year&lt;/em&gt; long… we collaborate with certainty in order to find meaning in life. Certainty isn’t a train ride in a park. It’s a rollercoaster, or better yet, a dance partner. It dips and spins us, tensing and relaxing in the dance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dips and spins come right on the beat each time, because certainty has an incredible sense of rhythm. The sun comes up each day predictably, on schedule. And when it rains on us the day we left our umbrella at home, we say to ourselves, &lt;em&gt;well perfect, exactly, of course it would.&lt;/em&gt; Even uncertainty, even unexpected circumstances, approach us to the beat, like a new dance partner at the ball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while we can’t know everything about what will happen to us, we also wouldn’t want to since it would ruin the music and take out all of the interesting parts of the rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And rhythm? That’s everything.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dont Stretch Pandiculate</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2018-12-03-dont-stretch-pandiculate/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was sitting in the car recently and I decided to sort of press my palm against the outside of my knee. My leg has this tendency to flail out toward the car door when I’m driving, and I felt the inexplicable need to hold it straight so my leg was straight for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think this: |/ vs this | | |&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I did this at first, I used my muscles to hold my leg in place, which was unnecessary since I was using my hand/arm muscles to do that for me. Once I realized this, I kept my hand where it was but completely relaxed my leg muscles. The result was a feeling I had never experienced, or at least had been aware that I had experienced: my leg was completely relaxed but also not just freely falling to the side, due to my hand being there to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;I was sitting in the car recently and I decided to sort of press my palm against the outside of my knee.

&lt;p&gt;Think this: |/ vs this | | |&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I did this at first, I used my muscles to hold my leg in place, which was unnecessary since I was using my hand/arm muscles to do that for me. Once I realized this, I kept my hand where it was but completely relaxed my leg muscles. The result was a feeling I had never experienced, or at least had been aware that I had experienced: my leg was completely relaxed but also not just freely falling to the side, due to my hand being there to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized this wasn’t quite a &lt;em&gt;stretch&lt;/em&gt; in the traditional sense; for the most part, I was relaxing my leg rather than tensing it. My arm muscles were contracted in order to keep the leg in place, but it was the leg that felt relaxed in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I took to the internet to figure out what this feeling is called, if there’s even a name for it. And I found the word &lt;em&gt;pandiculation&lt;/em&gt; which is the process in which an animal voluntary contracts into a muscle, lengthens the muscle, and fully relaxes. My hand was an assistant in the car example, but the same thing could be achieved with blocks in Yoga, or even some positions, like cat cow. That wonderful feeling of relaxation you get with the cow side of cat cow? That’s pandiculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the feeling you get when you wake up in the morning and do a big stretch and yawn. The position you hold as you yawn is the pandiculation pose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website Essential Somatics &lt;a href=&#34;http://essentialsomatics.com/hanna-somatics-articles-case-studies/pandiculation-safe-alternative-stretching&#34;&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This action, much like a pleasant yawn, re-sets both muscle length and function at the brain level; it “reminds” our muscles that they don’t have to stay stuck in a contracted state. Pandiculation “turns on a light” in the sensory motor system and improves proprioception, which helps you sense your own body more accurately. When you contract a muscle tighter than its present contraction rate, the brain (the command center of the muscles) receives strong sensory feedback, which allows it to “refresh” its sensation of the muscles. By slowly lengthening from that initial contraction, the brain can then lengthen the muscle past the point of its former, tighter length and into a new, fuller range. The result is a more relaxed muscle and renewed voluntary muscle control and coordination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site also goes on to say that static stretching (the regular kind) can be harmful depending on your circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now, instead of a morning stretch, I do some pandiculations. It is oddly satisfying and leaves me in a good place to tackle the challenges of the day. And I think about my life and the fact that most of the times where I take risks, I’m stretching. I’m doing something willingly that feels like tension. It’s a goal of mine now to lengthen into these situations, to relax, to breathe, to pandiculate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way, I remind my brain that it doesn’t always have to stay stuck in a contracted state.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Two Kinds Of Holidays</title>

+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two kinds of holidays per recognized major US holiday. One for kids and the one for adults. They occur on the same date but are expressed in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child, we enjoy the magic of each holiday. There’s a certain buzz in the air and school is often cooling down for the semester or quarter. Lots of indoor activities, and lots of sugar. Perhaps there’s a plane trip to Europe in our future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;As an adult, we’re beholden to family functions and travel logistics. Part of the joy that children feel when they experience the holidays has to do with their time perception; an evening that Is 3-4 hours long may feel much longer to a child enjoying a special holiday. For the adults, Thanksgiving dinner feels like it’s over in a flash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child, Christmas is receiving gifts. As an adult, it’s wondering when it’s too early to tell your child the truth about Santa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child, Thanksgiving dinner is about tradition and predictability during that long break from school. As an adult, it’s about attending a very tedious potluck, followed by days of overeating due to snacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child, New Years Eve is an endless night of staying up way later than normal (and parents being okay with it!). As an adult, New Years Eve means January, the longest month, is happening &lt;em&gt;tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though perhaps the way we express ourselves around the holidays is different between children and adults, the slow-down of the daily hustle and bustle makes everyone feel just a little more peaceful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, adults would do well to look at how children celebrate holidays, and perhaps consider returning to that structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the breaks, I used to have so little to do that I was bored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I aim for that life again, at least for just a little bit at the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Two Kinds Of Sleep</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2018-12-01-two-kinds-of-sleep/</link>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/posts/2018-12-01-two-kinds-of-sleep/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are two kinds of sleep. We can’t meaningfully control which one we get when we fall, but we can tell which one it was when we wake up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first kind feels like a recharge. It feels like being tired when we get into bed, and slightly less tired when we wake up. Sometimes, we’re not quite sure how we slept until hours later, when we’re head down at our cubicle. Other times, we make it through the day just fine, even without coffee.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;There are two kinds of sleep. We can’t meaningfully control which one we get when we fall, but we can tell which one it was when we wake up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first kind feels like a recharge. It feels like being tired when we get into bed, and slightly less tired when we wake up. Sometimes, we’re not quite sure how we slept until hours later, when we’re head down at our cubicle. Other times, we make it through the day just fine, even without coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first kind is the most common. It’s almost invisible. We do it habitually. We enjoy the rituals. It’s only somewhat reliable but it’s what we’ve got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second kind is the kind that comes from nights of half-sleep, and it’s especially bad if the sleeper doesn’t really know how poorly they’ve been sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the kind where your head hits any part of the pillow or bed and you already feel perfectly safe and comfortable. Maybe we get a second to wrap the blanket, maybe we don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the type of sleep where it feels as if we climbed into a tiny boat on a port in perfect evening weather, and without any cue from us, the boat starts pulling away from the dock and there’s absolutely nothing we can do but sail into sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last thought we have before our eyes close is &lt;em&gt;oh oh oh oh oh&lt;/em&gt;…. and the first feeling we have upon waking is feeling like our noses are full of salt water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No time for bedtime stories, alarms, warm baths, chamomile, or soft music. Just an entirely different universe, and one where dreams occur often. This type of sleep is a creative act. This type of sleep is painting on a canvas so furiously that it hurts to be interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of sleep solves our vision problems for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s much more rare though and it sneaks up on us during the winter hibernation holidays, when we have a longer runway on which to unfurl, when we remember to nap again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all good things, we can’t get the second kind every time. It would be too much. Like all good things, we do the second kind in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so most nights are spent with the first kind of sleep, dreaming about the next time we will experience the second kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bear went over the mountain, but not for food, or money, or fame, or glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bear went over the mountain due to his overwhelming curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see what he could see, from a new vantage point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bear went over the mountain, the bear went over the mountain… it’s simple, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see what he could see, that’s all. No expectations, no promises, no guarantees, no filters, and no judgment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The bear went over the mountain due to his overwhelming curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see what he could see, from a new vantage point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bear went over the mountain, the bear went over the mountain… it’s simple, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see what he could see, that’s all. No expectations, no promises, no guarantees, no filters, and no judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Delayed Journaling And The Value Of A Moment</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A small but important change I made recently to my journaling process is that I practice delayed journaling – journaling about my day on the following day, instead of at night before I go to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I started doing this, I’ve been able to capture every day fully in my journal, and I also find my entries are less frustrated. There are less “ughs” – it appears that whatever I’m frustrated about usually doesn’t frustrate me as much the next day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I find the best time to journal is right when I wake up. I feel a sense of urgency to get on with the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; day, that I write down a more objective summary of the &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of each moment is always fluctuating and it’s hard to really judge the value of a moment while we’re in it. And maybe sleep helps us sort through those moments, separating the juicy from the stale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learn better from moments when we get some distance from them, zooming out for clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Hodge Lodge Can Bring To The Edges Of Culture</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was at a place in DC called the O St. Mansion. If you live or visit DC, I highly recommend going to this venue. I was there recording a podcast but had the chance to explore the grounds after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, it’s a huge mansion that has a number of different rooms, and each room has a completely different feel. It’s a functioning hotel, but the hotel isn’t really themed in any meaningful way – it’s a hodge-podge of culture and art.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In essence, it’s a huge mansion that has a number of different rooms, and each room has a completely different feel. It’s a functioning hotel, but the hotel isn’t really themed in any meaningful way – it’s a hodge-podge of culture and art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One room is a log cabin, another is a victorian room with super old furniture, another is a modern futuristic pod with stairs leading up to the bathtub that emerge from the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are hidden passages all around the entire building, 99 in fact, and it’s a challenge to find all of them. There’s a magician that comes through every week, which really fits the feel of the place (completely mysterious). Photos and videos are allowed and encouraged, which is great, because you need to see this place to believe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing that most surprised me in this place was the artwork and the books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of it is for sale. &lt;em&gt;Everything.&lt;/em&gt; Every last piece of art, and all of the books… which are scattered among all of the different rooms. You can find old, tattered books on just about any topic imaginable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having used my Kindle for about a decade now, the experience made me remember what it was like to go into a dime book store and browse the bins of 99 cent books. These tomes were dreamt up by writers, and probably went through a very intensive review process, only to end up in a bin that isn’t even organized by genre. But some of the best books I’ve found have been random. Amazon would’ve never suggested Astonish Yourself, which is a collection 99 ways to blow your own mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also made me think of the local library, and their music collection, and how random it seemed. Classic albums by Dire Straits, and then also the rare flop that no one listens to by Lyle Lovett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were it not for these mixed bins, these hodge lodges (a term I made up to describe a building of hodge podge) of culture and art, getting exposed to the edges of culture would become increasingly harder. It’d become something we’d have to seek out. Algorithms aren’t efficient at finding edges because algorithms aren’t built to surprise – they’re simply built to give us more of what we’ve already got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we don’t need more of what we already have. We need to discover new, we need to find the edges to truly delight our senses. And in order to discover, we have to put ourselves in places like the O St. Mansion, like the public library, or perhaps the local park that we’ve never explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I listen back on the music I liked in high school and college, there are all sorts of oddities in there. Things that are sometimes uncomfortable to listen to, but interesting nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, my playlists all sound like the same song… unless I make it a point to hunt for the edges of culture and art.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Does It Mean To Be A No Shoes Household</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, I was always caught off guard when a friend’s parent required all of us to take our shoes off when we came inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s to keep the carpet clean,” my mom explained to a perplexed 5 year old me, in the car on the short ride home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, over the years, I’ve met many more people who adhere to the rule of no shoes in the house, and I always thought it was about keeping the carpet clean… until recently.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, I was always caught off guard when a friend’s parent required all of us to take our shoes off when we came inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s to keep the carpet clean,” my mom explained to a perplexed 5 year old me, in the car on the short ride home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, over the years, I’ve met many more people who adhere to the rule of no shoes in the house, and I always thought it was about keeping the carpet clean… until recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was an acquaintance’s house and she explained that, yes, the rule that requires removal of shoes keeps the carpet clean – but it’s more about the function of the shoe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The world is full of harmful things on the ground, so we wear shoes to be able to travel gracefully and willfully without worrying about the terrain,” she said. “But in our home, we create the terrain ourselves. The carpet is meant to be walked on with bare feet. You can tell because if you walk on it with shoes, it gets muddy and worn quickly. But if you walk on it with bare feet, you feel like you’re walking on a cloud, the carpet receives your steps with grace, and so our terrain will last longer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s also a moment’s pause,” she added. “When you enter a space, removing your shoes requires that you lower yourself to the ground in praise. It puts a little time-gap between entering a door and using the space. A moment of appreciation, perhaps. Of gratitude. Of maybe a question to the space itself: what can I do for you? And what can you do for me?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It became immediately clear to me that I have disrespected &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; rooms in my life, and I now look at spaces in a much different way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Ephemeral Nature Of Book Genres</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2018-11-26-the-ephemeral-nature-of-book-genres/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was five, there were two genres of books: fiction and non-fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distinction was easy enough for little kids to understand: fiction meant that the story was made up, and non-fiction meant that the story was not made up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we got older, we realized that the genre of fiction was actually much more expansive than we realized. Fantasy books were much different than romance, despite sharing the common denominator of imagination, wonder, and surprise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;As we got older, we realized that the genre of fiction was actually much more expansive than we realized. Fantasy books were much different than romance, despite sharing the common denominator of imagination, wonder, and surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And non-fiction, we realized was much more expansive as well. How-to books are different from biographies and philosophy books were different than memoirs. Elementary school teachers now refer to this genre as &lt;em&gt;informational&lt;/em&gt;, which made more sense to me as a new teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even that can be a misnomer, since all books, even fictional ones, contain information. The difference seems to be that the consequences of attaining that information can have a direct effect on a person’s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, can’t the information attained in a fictional book have direct consequences on someone’s life? Clearly, lives have been changed by fiction – for me, A Wrinkle in Time altered my interests and how I thought about the world around me, even though it’s about teenagers traveling to alternate universes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, don’t informational books also contain narratives? Most of the informational books I read nowadays seem to be chalk full of stories that illuminate the main points of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s that all books can have the same effect on us, no matter the genre. To inspire, to encourage, to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So can we rid Kindergarten classrooms of the dichotomy of fiction vs. non-fiction? I think we can, quite safely. Because kids, like adults, want their perspective and world view to be changed by the stories of others. But I’ve met many a kid who claims to like one genre over the other. They’ve been sold on the idea that one book informs and the other sparks the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that’s false. Let’s teach kids that books are collections of words meant to be interpreted by each individual in their own way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s teach them more about how to &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; the relevant information to their own lives, to look for hints about which books might cause this shift in them, and to know what it feels like to be inspired by words, whether it’s a dragon racing across the sky or the Art of War.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, someone’s how-to book could have the same function as someone else’s travel memoir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minute you think you’ve missed the bus, there’s one coming around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minute you think that the moment has passed, another one has taken its place (and another one has already taken the second one’s place).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minute you think that it’s going be to &lt;em&gt;this way&lt;/em&gt;, another path illuminates, taking you &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Losing Yourself</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2018-11-24-losing-yourself/</link>

&lt;p&gt;“I think I’m losing myself,” a friend told me recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had just had his second kid, and from my perspective, things had been going somewhat well for him. I asked for clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said, “Life moves so quickly and all of my old hobbies and ways that I used to live my life seem to have been muted by the needs of my family. I just feel like I’m a shadow of my former self. ”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;He said, “Life moves so quickly and all of my old hobbies and ways that I used to live my life seem to have been muted by the needs of my family. I just feel like I’m a shadow of my former self. ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have any answers or wisdom; after all, I’m on my first child, and he isn’t even walking and talking yet. But it made me stop for a minute, because this wasn’t a person that I ever thought would describe themselves as a shadow, kids or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I think of losing something, I think about what it means to be lost. Directionless. No map. Uncomfortable. Despair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel you’ve lost yourself, perhaps it feels exactly like this. You’re used to setting your own sail, you’re used to charting your own course, and now you have to chart the course for a family-entity. You can’t just listen to your inner voice anymore, that was murky and hard to hear to begin with. Now, you have to hear the external voices of others, and try to interpret them, and serve their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an entirely different way of living, and I suppose it’s what people mean when they say they’re a “family person.” No longer are the choices you make for yourself. They’re for the good of your familial unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I think about what it would take to find yourself again. When something is found, it happens through careful inspection and the retracing of steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid I used to lie on the floor and stare deeply into the carpet fibers. I’d look for bacteria and other small particles, even though I’d never be able to see them. But, I remember catching a glimpse of what the floor look liked under the carpet. And from then on, I couldn’t picture a carpeted floor any other way than a cold bare piece of concrete covered in fabric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience changed my perspective. And much like losing yourself happens because you lose a familiar perspective, finding yourself is all about developing a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one loses and finds themselves, the person or life that they re-claim is probably not the same one they lost; they just made meaning out of their situation in a way that felt like a discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes years to lose yourself, and probably years to find yourself again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s a micro-level to it as well. You can discover new parts of your identity every day. And you can accumulate new meaning at about the same rate as you discard old meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to stay on top of this exchange, admittedly. And it won’t necessarily mean you feel found very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s a good alternative to being lost all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When we’re faced with a choice, it sometimes feels like we’re standing facing two or more doors, and thinking hard about which one to go through. We know that once we enter one of the doors, we can’t come back out and have a do-over without serious consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of decisions prompt us to think about the future. What will happen when we make a choice? How will it affect our livelihood, our families, our moods, and our wallets?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;These types of decisions prompt us to think about the future. What will happen when we make a choice? How will it affect our livelihood, our families, our moods, and our wallets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these situations, it helps to remember that this isn’t the first time we’ve been here — in fact, we’ve chosen to enter &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; doors over the course of our life. So the act of picking is not the intellectual work; the work comes from remembering &lt;em&gt;the last doorway&lt;/em&gt; we walked through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in the garage of an office recently, and was a bit nervous that I’d forget where my car was. As I walked into the elevator bank to go upstairs, I noticed this sign:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were other doors to come through as well, with different images (a plane, a car, a boat, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, I was able to remember exactly which door I came through, not by a number or color, but an actual image, and one that encourages and embodies forward motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I ask myself: what doorway did I walk through recently that encouraged and embodies forward motion? Which doors kept me stagnant?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t know where you’re going until you understand where you’ve been, true. But you can’t know where you’ve been if you don’t remember which doorway you walked through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m thankful for thankfulness. Thanksgiving always forces me to stop and enjoy small moments. Maybe thankfulness is just the feeling we have when we’re enjoying life. And maybe we can remember how it feels to do that in the summer, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many ads, when they state the price of the thing they’re selling, follow it with “that’s the price of a cup of coffee!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this trope is supposed to illuminate is the idea that the product being sold is affordable, and we mindlessly spend that much on other things anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cup of coffee?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What kind of coffee are we taking? A latte? Lattes are pretty expensive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;…what size? A smaller size is significantly less expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Store bought or made at home? The coffee I make at home is probably less than a dollar per cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the final truth after thinking it all through is that I actually didn’t need that coffee to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched Coco recently (I’m late to the party). My first thought afterward was how poignant the idea of music as legacy is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we pass down our music to our children, we give them a little piece of our soul. It’s true for the original songs I write for my kid, and it’s true for the Beatles and ABBA records my dad played constantly on our road trips in the 90s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A song that is loved and shared and loved again is a legacy. When it’s shared with us, we quickly co-opt it as our own; when we share it with someone else who loves it, the effect of the song becomes 10 times as strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To remember someone is to keep their spirit alive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often sing beloved songs of the dead at their funerals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a good thing, too. The music we share keeps our spirits alive.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Everyone Should Read The Power Of Habit</title>

&lt;p&gt;There are some books that I come across that go into my personal favorites section on my bookshelf. Most of these wouldn’t be that interesting to most people because they are refined and tuned to my particular interests such as magic and self-development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then there are some books that explain a part of human life so well that I have to recommend them to all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But then there are some books that explain a part of human life so well that I have to recommend them to all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Power Of Habit&lt;/em&gt; by Charles Duhigg is one of those books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I knew before I read it is that so much of what we do in life is habitual. Some of those habits are good (brushing your teeth before you go to bed) and some have an unwanted effect (going into the drive through every tome you pass it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I didn’t know is that habits are formed by three major components: a cue, a routine, and a reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, see McDonalds arches (cue) -&amp;gt; go into drive through and order nuggets (routine) -&amp;gt; enjoy tasty food (reward).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the book goes farther than that. The valuable part is that it tells you how to _modify_these habit loops. You just change one of the three steps in the loop and the outcome changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the fast food example, I tried changing the cue so that I didn’t even see the arches. This translated into driving home via a different route, one where I didn’t pass a drive through. Obviously it worked because there was no way I could even get the food in that case, but it was a strategy I wouldn’t have necessarily come to naturally. I would’ve probably said “ah, well, maybe I’ll just try to have more will power as I pass by…” which never really worked to break the habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a habit broke naturally. I used to work in a building with a food court downstairs with all sorts of bad for you food. When 1pm rolled around (cue) I’d head down to one of my favorite restaurants and order something full of oil and carbs (routine) and felt, for a moment, less shitty about my boring life working at a desk (reward).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I switched jobs in 2013 to become a teacher, the food court cue went away, so the routine did too. Some could argue I broke the habit because I removed the need for the reward. I got a job that I cared about and didn’t need to reward myself with shitty food anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Shitty food became a reward for feeling over stressed as a teacher but that’s besides the point.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to reverse engineer a habit, you can, and this book shows you how through many examples. It’s not the first time anyone has written about habits, but it is the most engaging, at least for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend reading it. It could change or even save your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to appreciate a moment? Write down the sensory details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to appreciate a person? Write them a love letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to appreciate a piece of art? Say how it makes you feel, regardless of whether it’s positive or negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to appreciate your kids? Watch them play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to appreciate a friend’s work? Gush over it, as sincerely as you can.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Appreciation is the art of noticing the value that other entities bring to your life and the lives of those around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a matter of intention and thought trains, not simple acts of kindness or service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all things deserve appreciation, but it’s more than you think.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>It Doesnt Matter How Much Things Change Its About Relationships</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The word relationship contains the words &lt;em&gt;ship&lt;/em&gt; and relate. Relate means &lt;em&gt;to connect&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m often told that I am good at keeping friends: I still hang out with at least 8 or so of my high school friends on a regular basis. Sometimes, I’m asked how I maintain these relationships for so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is that I’ve never really thought about it. Perhaps I’m better at maintaining long friendships, maybe more than most, but I didn’t realize how many other people wish they could do it too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The truth is that I’ve never really thought about it. Perhaps I’m better at maintaining long friendships, maybe more than most, but I didn’t realize how many other people wish they could do it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I feel like I’m just re-establishing my friend group every few years,” a friend confessed to me. “It’d be nice to have some consistency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People grow apart because they change. But it’s not the change that drives them apart. It’s the difficulty of the work required to &lt;em&gt;continue relating&lt;/em&gt; as people are changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t always relate to my friends in the same way I did when we first met. Grant and I bonded over Super Metroid and Blink 182, and that’s not at all how we relate these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could’ve let it fall apart, naturally and painlessly, as so many relationships do. But even in times where it felt like we no longer got each other, we kept trying to relate to even smallest detail of each other’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took effort, patience, interrogation, persistence, discovery, and maybe a little frustration, but these are the things that good friendship is built upon. And it is especially crucial to keep relating in times where it seems like there is nothing left with which to relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because that will happen at some point, maybe a year or maybe a decade in, and most people will shrug their shoulders and walk away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I firmly believe that two people can change dramatically over a period of time, and still be able to relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better yet, I believe any two people can relate, period. It just takes digging and intention. It happens every day with the people and in the places we least expect.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Pause Mid Flit</title>

&lt;p&gt;In a diner somewhere, there’s a waiter that is serving 10-15 tables for lunch. And each one of the customers has a different story. One was late to meet a friend, and it’s the only time she’s ever been late. One customer has just finished his final round of chemo, and the diner food is his celebration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In a diner somewhere, there’s a waiter that is serving 10-15 tables for lunch. And each one of the customers has a different story. One was late to meet a friend, and it’s the only time she’s ever been late. One customer has just finished his final round of chemo, and the diner food is his celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waiter is flitting between these worlds, witnessing the &lt;em&gt;essence&lt;/em&gt; of these stories. He’s trying to not become too curious, too interested; that would be unprofessional but would also make his job more emotionally taxing. His job is to provide a great customer experience, and to take some responsibility for occasional problems that he cannot control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a doctor in Iowa treating 12 patients today. Each of the patients has a different story. One patient has hypochondria, but also has a cold, and also recently lost her mother. One patient is feeling well, but the slight pain in his ribs is actually a kidney stone. Another patient is there with her three kids to get a flu shot, and she secretly hates all of them because they remind her of their father, who left years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctor is flitting between these universes, trying not to get lost, or absorbed too deeply. Her job is to make sure that the patients are healthy. To get too involved would be unprofessional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These stories underlie the customer experience. When the doctor asks the age-old question, “What brought you here today?” they are pausing mid-flit, whether they like it or not. When the waiter asks, “What can I get for you?” he’s not just talking about food. And when the customer gives his dinner order, he’s hoping that the experience of eating food in this diner will cause some change in his life, however small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of us flit every day. At the mall, at our jobs, on the phone with customer service. The people we interact with have important stories to tell, stories that we conveniently ignore and shove aside because of the fear of information overload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not advocating that we start to flit less. But perhaps we should make our mid-flit pauses longer. If only for a second, to connect with someone who craves a connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A moment is all it takes. And the world would change.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When someone takes a photo of us, we are asked to smile. But at whom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not the person taking the picture, so it must be the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The camera, the thing that sees our perfect moments, the ones that show us living our lives in an enviable way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the camera know that we are lying? Or is it stupid and oblivious to all the pain the lies behind a simple selfie?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had this situation happen when I feel like I have a memory that is so perfectly wedged into my mind, only to watch a videotape of the memory later on and find out that what I remembered isn’t what actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, I’ll have a memory is speckled with details from another memory. I’ll remember the correct sequence of events, but I’ll remember Bill making a particular comment when it was really Steve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It probably happens more than I think. By probably, I mean almost certainly. And that’s kind of scary to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It means that perhaps every memory I’ve constructed could be &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; off. Sure, I might remember certain details correctly, but how I can discern which details are correct and which aren’t, especially in the absence of a video or audio recording?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Interestingly, the same thing happens with movies. I remember certain scenes, certain intonations differently than what is actually on film. In fact, sometimes when I re-watch a film I know well, I have to check to make sure it wasn’t re-cut. That’s how strong my belief in my memory is.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it’s kind of liberating. If my brain works this way, it’s certain that other people have the same issue. That means the way I remember certain events is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; how other people remember them. And not just in a slightly different perspective sort of way, I mean &lt;em&gt;fundamentally&lt;/em&gt; different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of us remember anything. We believe we have a memory, but that memory may be corrupt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess this is why the gurus keep telling us to live in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>No Encore</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2018-11-13-no-encore/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw a show the other night in DC. It was a band called the Night Game and according to Spotify, it’s my most played band of the last couple of years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They played a dynamite set, but there was something that I noticed: the set was a little over an hour long, and there was no encore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The encore, that little bit of showmanship that happens after the main set is over, after the band retreats to the backstage and the audience is cheering for them to return, usually contains a crowd pleaser, and it’s always served as a cool way to give the audience something &lt;em&gt;extra&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The thing about this show was that all the excitement was perfectly contained in the main set. So much so that when the main set was over, I was ready to leave, even if there was an encore. I had heard everything I needed to hear and was fully satiated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes me wonder how many bands devise setlists that don’t fully satiate their audience, so much that they have to rely on the idea of an encore to create excitement. It’s also odd to me that in all of the hundreds of shows I’ve been to in my life, this is the first time I can remember a headliner just ending their set without an encore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the saying should go “Dance like nobody’s watching, and play your set like there is no encore.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Secret Song</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back when CDs were how people listened to music, there was a trend to include secret song at the end of the album (sometimes more).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track wouldn’t be listed on the back of the album’s case, so there was no way to really know if it was there. But sure enough, you’d pop in your CD and your CD player would tell you that there are &lt;em&gt;14&lt;/em&gt; tracks instead of 13.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The secret song always felt like a little post script. It wasn’t the final song on the album, it was the after thought. It was the song that the band would sometimes play at a show, and only a few people would really get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no room for secret songs on a digital platform. If the file/song is there, it’s visible in the folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that little piece of mystique was removed by our migration to digital streaming, then it’s safe to say that there are some other pieces that were removed as well. Like the importance of cover art to sell a record, in the same way that wine labels sell wine. We say that we don’t like to judge books by their covers, but if we’re trying a wine we’ve never tried before, that’s our &lt;em&gt;only option.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was just confessing to someone the other day that I haven’t connected to an album the way I used to, in quite a while. It makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While my writing frequency has ebbed and flowed over the years, I’ve consistently written and published pieces since the early 2000’s. I did this &lt;em&gt;despite&lt;/em&gt; my education in grade school writing, not &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of my education. In school, we were taught that the writing process was a process of brainstorming (whatever that means), organizing thoughts, writing drafts, and editing the drafts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I’ve noticed that my own process is much different from the one that I have taught.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I’ve noticed that my own process is much different from the one that I have taught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how I approach the process of writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mindset is important. Writing is how I think and parse ideas. If you ever read a finished piece of writing from me and it seems like I’ve really thought something through, it’s likely that I did that “thinking through” during the writing/drafting process. It’s happening right now, as I write these words. So, I write to think, which causes growth, therefore I write to grow. One could say I write to learn. This motivation is all that I need to do it every day, just like how someone trying to become stronger would try to lift heavier weights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most important part of writing doesn’t happen in front of the computer. It happens by being mindful each day. If I go into the city, I might see something that surprises me, or makes me curious. I have a running list of these noticings on my phone. Sometimes in the form of pictures, sometimes it’s a little bit of text. Sometimes it’s a statement and sometimes it’s a question.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, I have a daily habit of sitting down to write. I pull out my list, which generally has about 70-80 workable ideas (I note &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; when I’m out and about), and I write about one of the ideas. I edit as I go, because doing this daily means I don’t have too much time to spend on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I feel like it’s ready to ship, I publish. The next day I do it again. Some posts are read, shared, and liked… some are read by no one. I promote ones that I think are relevant to a good number of people in my network, and sometimes I send a post to a person who I think will connect to the idea I’ve written about that day. I love when my work is enjoyed and read, but I press on even when it’s not. This is &lt;em&gt;key&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, there’s only one step in this process that, if left out, causes a slowdown in publishing, and that’s Step #3. That list of ideas will become bloated and eventually useless if I don’t &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; those ideas in some way. Kind of like eating too much and never expending any energy through a workout. Also, if I don’t publish regularly, I stop noticing interesting things in life. I don’t know if it’s subconscious, as if I have too many ideas I haven’t written about and so my brain shuts out new stimuli, or if it’s just because the daily habit reminds me to look for interesting ideas… but when I stop publishing, the ideas stop coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way to keep getting new ideas consistently is to keep writing consistently. Any writing teacher will tell you this, but it is hard to really believe until you stop writing for a while. Whatever personal process you have is useless if you aren’t writing regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It goes against the traditional ideas of the muse, of inspiration, of lightning striking, of lightbulb moments. But any professional can tell you that those romantic ideas are more like locks than they are keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giving in&lt;/strong&gt; is to succumb to internal desire or fear. You might give in to your kid’s demands for waffles for dinner because you’re fearful that he might have a tantrum. Or you might give in to the desire to eat an entire chocolate cake at 2am on a Tuesday. Giving in means you’ve surrendered to your reptilian brain in some way. It’s hard to control giving in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giving out&lt;/strong&gt; is to succumb to external forces. Your arms can give out when you can no longer carry a heavy object. A house’s roof can give out in an intense storm. It’s hard to control giving out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giving up&lt;/strong&gt; is to succumb to the internal voice in your head, the one telling you that you’re unworthy or less powerful than you are. Giving up requires a chain of thought. It is a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving up is what happens when giving in causes giving out. Giving up is the final step in the process of devaluing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stand strong.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dreams Are Rehearsals</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2018-11-09-dreams-are-rehearsals/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t always have dreams that I remember. When I do, I mark them down in a dream journal I keep in an app called Day One. This is also where I keep a regular journal which is sort of a log of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s nice about Day One is that you can line these journals up and see where your dream events and life events intersect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did this recently and I noticed that I usually have dreams I remember during really heavy times in my life, whether it’s work or personal. It makes sense, considering that stress can interrupt normal sleep cycles, and interrupting sleep cycles can sometimes spur dreams (which is why if you set an alarm for 3am and then go back to sleep, you can sometimes force a dream).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always thought of dreams as rehearsals for events that may happen in some universe. And during heavy or stressful times, my brain feels the need to rehearse. After all, rehearsal is preparation, and my brain seems to crave preparation in times of high stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting twist: my nightmares are mostly stories about being unprepared. Setting up for a concert but forgetting my guitar at home, on stage at a play but I don’t know my lines etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the nightmares serve to scare my brain into dreaming so I can prepare for life. Like an endless subconscious cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Being A Highly Sensitive Person</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2018-11-08-on-being-a-highly-sensitive-person/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//localhost:1313/posts/2018-11-08-on-being-a-highly-sensitive-person/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For most of my life, I’ve been told that I’m &lt;em&gt;too sensitive&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been called &lt;em&gt;too sensitive&lt;/em&gt; when I’ve cried over something that someone else deemed not cry-worthy. I’ve been &lt;em&gt;too sensitive&lt;/em&gt; when I withdraw from conversation if somebody is ribbing me too hard. &lt;em&gt;Too sensitive&lt;/em&gt; if I’m offended by something that was “meant as a harmless joke.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember when I was a kid, asking my mom about this. About why I seemed to react differently than other people to teasing, or to any hint of aggression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;For most of my life, I’ve been told that I’m &lt;em&gt;too sensitive&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been called &lt;em&gt;too sensitive&lt;/em&gt; when I’ve cried over something that someone else deemed not cry-worthy. I’ve been &lt;em&gt;too sensitive&lt;/em&gt; when I withdraw from conversation if somebody is ribbing me too hard. &lt;em&gt;Too sensitive&lt;/em&gt; if I’m offended by something that was “meant as a harmless joke.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember when I was a kid, asking my mom about this. About why I seemed to react differently than other people to teasing, or to any hint of aggression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’ve got to grow a thick skin,” she’d say. And I’d sit there, grunting desperately, trying to grow a thicker skin. Turns out that’s not how skin growth works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, it’s the sensitivity that creates a vicious cycle. Being highly sensitive means I react to situations in ways that others feel is unnecessary, which opens me up to more criticism around this quirk, which then pokes at my sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been told that I’ve been bullied in my life &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of my sensitivity. That it’s my fault, for being the person that I am, that people tend to pick on me more than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you’d just show that you didn’t care, it wouldn’t happens as much,” a million friends and family would tell me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And still, try as I might, I care, and my face doesn’t take orders from my brain so easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an interesting sidenote, sensitivity seems to be a coveted skill in the business world. While I’ve heard a lot of “stop being so sensitive” in my personal life, I’ve heard a lot “be sensitive to the needs of the customer” on the business end. Same skill, but in this context, being sensitive is a positive trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as a result, most of my life has been spent as a highly sensitive person trying to navigate a world of people who don’t seem to really get it, or think it’s a flaw in my personality that I need to try and correct. But in my 30’s, I’ve learned that there’s a duality to all of our personality traits: while my sensitivity makes me vulnerable, it’s also helped me with most of my greatest achievements in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write songs and make albums that move people &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; I am highly sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a caring educator &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; I am highly sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a healthy relationship with my spouse &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; I am highly sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a good father &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; I’m highly sensitive to the needs of my child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I found that there was actually a name for people like me (Highly Sensitive Person) and that there was even a &lt;em&gt;book&lt;/em&gt; about people like me, I was relieved. The book, The Highly Sensitive Person, talked about how sensitivity is just the result of a finely tuned nervous system. It made sense – things like bright lights and really loud sounds have always bothered me as well, because they stimulate my nervous system a little too vigorously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I can often sense subtext in a person’s tone more quickly than other people can. I can recognize unfamiliar voice tones blindfolded. I can tell you what type of guitar someone is using on a recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can feel people’s pain, joy, sadness, etc just by looking at their face. It’s why it’s so hard for me to give condolences to someone who is grieving. I take one look at their face and I’m grieving too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a little bit like a superpower sometimes, which feels weird to say considering that for most of my life I’ve thought of my sensitivity as a curse. Being an HSP allows me to connect to people on a human level that develops an almost immediate and mutual trust. A connection that is rooted deeply in emotion. The type of connection we all crave but is so hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, I’ve started to view my sensitivity as a strength, as an internal compass, an asset. The thing that has plagued me for so long is now becoming my greatest tool against adversity, and the thing that creates the most value in my relationships. I’ve started to be honest and upfront about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all owe it to the world to embrace who we are as individuals. We owe it to ourselves to avoid shame-induced conformity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your faults are speckled with value, and they always have been.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Moms Jewish Dads A Pisces</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was invited to a dinner recently at a friend’s house and I didn’t really know anyone. I started talking about the child I was expecting at the time (who arrived in August) and the person I was talking to interrupted me and asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, what religion will your child be if you and your wife aren’t from the same one?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me by surprise, not because I hadn’t ever thought about it, but because my child hadn’t even been born yet. The question of what religion they’ll be (or gender, or what their diet will be like) seemed irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;I was invited to a dinner recently at a friend’s house and I didn’t really know anyone. I started talking about the child I was expecting at the time (who arrived in August) and the person I was talking to interrupted me and asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, what religion will your child be if you and your wife aren’t from the same one?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me by surprise, not because I hadn’t ever thought about it, but because my child hadn’t even been born yet. The question of what religion they’ll be (or gender, or what their diet will be like) seemed irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife is Jewish and I was raised as a Muslim but at some point stopped identifying as one (more on that in a later post). I still celebrate Muslim holidays with my family, but I don’t attend religious services regularly, or say prayers, or fast during Ramadan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I got a little flustered when this lady started questioning me about my unborn child’s religion. What will religion _will they be? _&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a moment, I pictured myself in a store with religions on shelves. The price tag on all of them say “free,” but as with anything, there are hidden costs. For instance, you lose a little bit of life autonomy when you’re forced into a religion at birth. When you’re labelled as a person who believes in something just because your parents do. Some call it inheritance, but I see it as unfair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we could tell our child that they’re a mix of our two religions. That seems to make sense. Until you start to construct this new type of religion hybrid, and realize that ultimately, the biggest difference is in the name of the religion, the traditions and rites of passage are slightly different in execution but similar in spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps we could let them decide. That seems to make sense too, until you realize that giving two options of religions is kind of limiting. What if they want to be part of a religion that neither of their parents are part or?What if they don’t want to be associated with a religion &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So perhaps we could let them just be them, and ignore religion entirely. That seems to make sense, and sounds good too. But then the traditions and holidays and cultural elements that you, as a parent, enjoy so much are lost on your kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s all too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While my view on this is always changing, this is the framework I’ve settled on for now: a child should have &lt;em&gt;access&lt;/em&gt; to their family’s heritage, to the components that make up their history. It’s not the same as picking, and it’s not the same as ignoring religion altogether. The idea of &lt;em&gt;access&lt;/em&gt; includes religion and also transcends religion at the same time. For instance, my child will have access to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Judaism, through his mom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Islam, through his grandparents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Music, through his dad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-help literature, through his dad,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rock climbing, through his aunt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and anything else that he is given access to through the people he interacts with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone were to ask me what I identify with, I’d say it’s with being a Pisces. No set of personality traits and spiritual connections seems to sum me up better than the astrological sign of Pisces, which is my star sign. I connect to this sign not because it’s my star sign, but because the stereotype fits who I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even though my child is a Virgo, there are lessons to pass on from the realm of the Pisces, like how it’s okay to have strong emotions, and how it’s okay to use your nervous system as a compass rather than be ashamed of it. So my son has access to the personality traits of a Pisces, through his father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mom’s Jewish, Dad’s a Pisces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auntie’s temples are mountains with boulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grandpa’s altar is the stove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncle’s hymns come from the Grateful Dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you, dear child, have access to this whole universe of constellations that we form through the the histories to which &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; have been given access. You can take it all, take none of it, or find other points of access outside of our family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these declarations, we widen the meaning of what it means to have a belief system, and who our prophets are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world where our rigid and limited belief systems are the cause of such hatred and exclusion, is there any greater gift to give to a brand new human?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I voted this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many people, my polling place was at a local school. And in our case, it’s the one that our son might attend in a few years as a kindergartener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my wife and I walked in, we looked above our heads and noticed that students had been allowed to paint the tiles of the building as different flags of the world. It was an immediately moving experience; it felt inclusive and flew in the face of so much AmericaFirst rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Not only that, when I visit a school and see student-made decorations on the walls, I silently thank whomever is in charge (and verbally too, if I know who they are). But on the ceiling, and on &lt;em&gt;tiles&lt;/em&gt;? That’s a whole new level of student centered community. Many principals would call that defacing school property, but this artwork was the community’s statement: &lt;em&gt;this school, right down to the ceiling tiles, belongs to all of us, and all of us, wherever we’re from, belong here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the perfect place to fill out a ballot and vote for leadership. In a place where voices are heard, and voices matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I should know. I was a teacher at a school where student and teacher voice was very limited. I saw the effects that this had on the small universe that existed within the walls of the school. I saw it tear apart relationships and how it turned well-meaning adults into the type of people that they’d rather not be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our country feels a bit like that school right now. But our voices can and will be heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ceiling tiles of this country belong to us. And today is painting day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there anything more sad than reading a scathing review? To scathe, according to the dictionary, means to harm. So a scathing review is, in its essence, seeking to harm the piece of art it’s criticizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a misnomer anyway. Ideas can be harmed about as much a square peg can harm a round hole. So the scathing review reads more like the anger one feels over the fact that they can’t connect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I can’t say I blame them. After all, it is downright &lt;em&gt;confusing&lt;/em&gt; to not understand a piece of art, or to miss its appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some people who enjoy reading scathing reviews (scathe-porn). In fact, I read a study once that claimed that people tend to think a reviewer is smarter if the review is negative (which may mean some of the scathe is artificial).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only read glowing reviews. To glow, to emit a steady light without a flame, is calming and invigorating. And when I’m done with a glowing review, it makes the consumption or art (or re-consumption) all the more fulfilling. I can better understand the highs and lows, the peaks and the valleys, especially with a good writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, I’ll skip a movie if it was canned in general, but not if I really wanted to see it. But mostly, I want to feel hungry for a piece of art after reading a reviews, not hopeless. And I certainly don’t want to take someone’s opinion to heart if they didn’t understand the appeal. It’s like avoiding bowling because someone said the shoes look ugly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to feel the warmth of the glow rather than the burn of the scathe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s why I’ll only write positive reviews for art. Maybe it’s that I don’t get paid to review, but I’d much rather spend my relatively few days on this earth glowing than scathing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For each of the huge life events (graduation, buying a house, having a baby, getting married, etc.) there are a number of things people will say to you as the life event approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For marriage, it’s always an older uncle or relative turning to the man and saying with a wink “and remember, she’s always right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my wife and I were expecting, it was things like “you’ll never get sleep again!”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;When my wife and I were expecting, it was things like “you’ll never get sleep again!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing about these pieces of advice is that they’re not actually advice. They’re phrases that seem to surround a cultural life event – but they don’t actually help you through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saying that “she’s always right” to a heterosexual man getting married is maybe well-intentioned, but it completely minimizes the importance of good communication, and the fact that argument is how you work through problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telling expecting parents that they’ll never sleep again will perhaps prepare them for the tediousness of childcare, but it minimizes the enrichment of having a child – the fact that you lose sleep &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; you love your child and want to meet their needs. More on this in a later post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of life events are framed as if we’re giving something up. Independence, mostly, with marriage and children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe. But that’s a bleak way of looking at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps in order to maintain a strong family, it’s necessary to give up the convenience of independence occasionally. But in return we gain co-dependence. Others depend on us, sure, but we depend on others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When shit goes awry, my wife has my back, and vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my kid is hungry, my wife or I bond with him while we feed him. One day, he might even feed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, when my kid deals with conflict in Kindergarten, he will depend on me to help guide him through it. And he may dole out that wisdom back to me one day when I deal with conflict. I might see my advice reflect back at me in the most beautiful way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I wasn’t married, and if I didn’t have a kid, I wouldn’t have to worry about &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of this. It’d be all about me, all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m glad it’s not all about me. I’m glad that I’ll lose sleep to take care of someone that I’ll love. Happy that I’ll have to make concessions in order to maintain a healthy marriage. These are skills that make us stronger and more generous people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s re-think the ritualistic wisdom. A lot of the misery people associate with it is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Life is just as beautiful and wondrous as decide it is.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Be A Philospher Find A Philosopher</title>

&lt;p&gt;For most of my life, I assumed that being a philosopher required a doctorate, and perhaps a following. Mountains of writing in language that only the most intellectual among us can understand, and most of all, &lt;em&gt;status&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I was having lunch with a spiritual leader in DC and we were trying to categorize a particular writer, and basically deciding whether or not this writer was a philosopher or just a &lt;em&gt;writer&lt;/em&gt;. That spurred a discussion about what it means to be a philosopher.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

That spurred a discussion about what it means to be a philosopher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went back and forth a bit, but eventually we came to the conclusion that being a philosopher is mostly about &lt;em&gt;asking questions&lt;/em&gt; about the nature of society or the universe or whatever it is. Interrogating assumptions and developing new thoughts about the underlying concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means there are far more philosophers in the world from whom you can seek wisdom than we ever realized. Your friends, your family, your favorite musicians, artists, elected officials (and unelected officials) make &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; philosophers. Why is their wisdom less valuable than Plato?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can be a philosopher in daily conversation. You can also seek out the philosophy in those conversations and elevate the voices of subtle philosophers, especially the ones that society has marginalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take it a step farther and write down interesting interrogations of ideas that you hear. Keep a file on your phone/notebook. Your own personal philosophy library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s an idea that is as empowering as it is comforting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 7th grade, the very first geography test of the year was a test to label all 7 continents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds easy, but there was a caveat: the continents were drawn on the paper out of context. As if the teacher took cut-outs of each continent and just spilled them onto a blank page in any order and photocopied it. Some were oriented differently, flipped around, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The teacher had a rule that &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; student had to not only pass the test, but they needed to get it perfect. Or else they would need to retake it at lunch every day until they got 100% correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took it 4 times. I was one of the last to get it. I’ve always had orientation and spacial issues, so it made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I think about it often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many super familiar things in my life would be unrecognizable if the orientation changed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would I recognize my bed if it was upside down?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would I know my sister’s face if her nose was on her forehead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would I know my own life if I woke up one day and my bedroom door was on the other side of the room?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The life we think we know so well is one flip away from being completely unrecognizable.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jerry Seinfeld once said that his secret to productivity was writing one joke per day, putting a big X on the day in his calendar and then doing that every day, so as not to “break the chain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using this life changing app called Productive to do the same. Every day I have to do 7 habits. The trick to doing this with a job and a little one is that I swipe off the goals if I even touch them. I read two pages of a book? Swipe. I made notes on a mix? Swipe. I fixed one piece of buggy code or played through some jazz chords? Swipe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is just to hit them every day, and of course the less I put in this app, the more progress I can make on each project but I’ve just never rolled that way. I’m a 72 projects at once kind of guy and I’ve just gotta accept that. The second screenshot shows my “perfect” days, which means I hit all of my goals. Sometimes, that took 30 mins. Sometimes 5 hours. It’s been very fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few moments after my son was born recently, I had what David Allen calls BFO, a Blinding Flash of Obvious. This is a term used to describe thoughts that are obvious in hindsight but kind of revelatory in the present. BFOs are how most of the best fiction and comedy are written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My BFO: many people are born every day, and many die every day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;My BFO: many people are born every day, and many die every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much information exists on those who are born today, there’s no public registry of births, and even if there was, there’s not much to know about babies at first other than they poop, eat, and cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obituaries, on the other hand, &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; give us some insight on the lives of those who have recently passed. And there’s a site called legacy.com that logs obituaries from around the country. So I went browsing through the site and noticed a pattern – almost every obituary talks about the preceding and succeeding family members of the deceased, and the deceased’s relationship to them, but almost &lt;em&gt;none&lt;/em&gt; of them give any extra information about the person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, you’ll see that one was a “loving mother” or a “dedicated grandfather.” But what else is there to clue us in on the &lt;em&gt;legacy&lt;/em&gt; that these folks leave behind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where’s their body of work? The thing that will live forever, whether in print or on the internet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it occurred to me that many people don’t have a body of work. Don’t have a website or a twitter where we can acquire their thoughts and perhaps use them to guide us in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I read an obituary, I want to understand who that person was, and what their lasting influence is. What did they believe? What did they stand for? How did they change or influence the world (as everyone does, even in a small way)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we need a new site for someone’s legacy. A place where we can store their body of work so that they can live on and influence us in the present. A graveyard where the ghosts of thoughts, innovations, and invention can live on and haunt the world in a positive way forever.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I miss MP3.com. It was one of the first services ever that allowed amateur musicians to just upload Mp3s of their homemade recordings and even order custom CDs with artwork and everything. It wasn’t super fancy, but man, it was cool back in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was this quick-release attitude with musicians on the site. You’d have to check back every now and then with your favorite bands to see if there was new music. You could stream the music in lo or hi fi or even pay for a download (and free downloads were like a gift).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Then, somewhere in between now and then, releasing music got complicated, and the trends changed often. At one point, everyone was doing the 2007 Radiohead thing and allowing listeners to pay what you want for full albums. Then, there was a movement to make albums sacred again, and vinyl had a resurgence. Then, Spotify took over and now everything is streaming all the time and the album is kind of a lost art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s all sorts of promo around album releases, pre-saving on Spotify, hype, and more hype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call me old fashioned, but I long for the days that I would record something on my computer microphone, send it to MP3.com and move on to the next thing. Some of those songs were hits (as much as a hit could be with a high school crowd), some were not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps if we removed all the hype, all of the necessary pre-announcing and Twittering when new music is coming out, artists would feel empowered to make a thing and then move on to another thing. Maybe it would encourage prolificness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if artists are being prolific, most likely the quality of their work is increasing too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bumper Sticker Culture</title>

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever seen a bumper sticker while driving that either enrages you or makes you fist bump your steering wheel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered who sits in that car and what they do with their days?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have. It’s kind of a hobby. It’s fascinating to me as a storyteller because those bumper stickers are a representation how that particular driver wishes to tell their story. It’s how they choose to embody their beliefs. The thing that’s safe about bumper stickers, of course, is that you can’t confront the driver very easily. So there’s much less fear involved with putting a controversial bumper sticker on the back of your vehicle than there is in making a public YouTube video, or speaking at a rally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;And the same goes for re-posting memes. Back in the day (a few years ago), people would post a meme that expressed a particular sentiment or belief (usually political) and would add their own comment: “THIS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exclamation of “this” was at least some indication of vulnerability. Now, not only do we share memes that have no known point of origin, but we also share the sub-comments, the “THIS”s from other people. It’s the type of thing that Jake Likes Onions uses as a humor device in his comics (the sub-comment is the title of the comic, and it comes after you read the comic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And unlike with driving, it’s &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; to confront the person inside the car, or behind the computer. You can flood them with comments or @mentions. But just like the bumper sticker scenario, minds aren’t changed. Rage is shared and perpetuated and multiplied. Wolf pack mentality ensues. Meme posting offers all the same problems that bumper stickers offer, except with an illusion of inviting a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does the invitation to an actual conversation look like? Well, it’s not in a bumper sticker or in-your-face meme. It can look different depending on the situation but the common quality of an invitation to conversation is this: we all sit in different places in our understanding of the world, and it is better to gain a perspective than it is to start by defending someone else’s.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Traffic lights are big. Bigger than you &lt;a href=&#34;http://i.imgur.com/2BX3GD6.jpg&#34;&gt;think&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re driving on the road, the traffic lights and street signs look like they might fit in the palm of your hand. When one comes down, or you get to see it close up, you realize that they’re much bigger than you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes me reflect on the nature of problems, and how they seem to appear out of nowhere. Problems only turn into problems when they’re right in front of us. When they’re off in the distance, it seems like no big deal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;We’re not a harsh parent until we are, but we probably could’ve worked on handling our frustration with our kids more productively prior to being a harsh parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santa wasn’t always Santa either – at some point he realized how big the world was, and how much magic he needed to make Christmas work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call it foresight, planning, details, whatever. At some point, you will find yourself with a traffic light on your foot, wondering how it grew so big so fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best we can do is remember that the size of everything is relative to the size of everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Being Spiritually Short</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The average male is about 5 ft 10, and I stand at a meager 5 ft 6, which makes me short. The interesting thing was that I never really noticed my shortness until it was pointed out once, in my 20’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since then, I identified as a short person. But I often wonder what would’ve happened if that person &lt;em&gt;hadn’t&lt;/em&gt; pointed out my shortness, causing me to acquire a new piece of identity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Would I have felt like I belonged in a world of varying heights? Would being short really have mattered or meant anything, like the way that my black hair isn’t good or bad, it just is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now I’ve come to realize that I’m not only physically short, but I am also spiritually short. I have a height advantage in this way; I can see what is happening to the trunks of the trees instead of towering over the forest. I’ve found that there are &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; who would like to know what’s happening to the bark, and thankfully I write a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’re a doctor who watches medical shows and throws the remote against the TV. Or maybe you’re a reporter who watches shows like The Newsroom. Hell, maybe you’re even a barista getting frustrated by watching the coffee-making employees at Central Perk on Friends. I can’t imagine what astronauts and scientists think about sci-fi shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, it’s being an educator and watching TV shows about teaching. There are so many tropes in shows about teaching that just don’t stack up to the reality of teaching. Here are a few myths&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;For me, it’s being an educator and watching TV shows about teaching. There are so many tropes in shows about teaching that just don’t stack up to the reality of teaching. Here are a few myths&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Teachers find kids annoying. **It’s a trope I’ve seen a lot in movies, especially, where the underlying feeling of a teacher toward their pupils is that of disgust and annoyance. Many of these teachers seem like they would like nothing more than to torture and punish their students, no matter what they did. The truth is that most teachers &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; their students. It’s not that they don’t get annoyed by certain behaviors, but they see the best in their students most of the time. They have to – it’s part of what it takes to do the job effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teachers are the only ones who can save their troubled students.&lt;/strong&gt; This one may the most overplayed trope. The idea of a teacher that’s going to walk into a classroom of wild and unruly kids, settle them completely with their incredibly engaging lectures and lesson ideas, and eventually set them straight on the path to college. This isn’t how it works. Yes, teachers are sometimes the only positive adults in some students’ lives, but that doesn’t mean that those adults will change or alter their paths and opportunities. No teacher sets out to change a student’s life – this is the by-product of a strong relationship. When it happens, it’s amazingly fulfilling to know that we played a role in it, but it wasn’t us who achieved anything – it was the student. We helped and we coached, but we didn’t make them pick up a pencil or do the writing. Furthermore, the change doesn’t happen right before our eyes when we teach. We show interest in the student and the student’s life, what makes them tick etc. We cultivate their self expression as best we can. And then one day they return to us as a high school senior who just got into their choice school. It’s not like Dead Poet’s Society.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Teachers are the only ones teaching. **It’s almost a misnomer to call us teachers or educators. Yes, we do teach lessons and give feedback. But all teachers, at least the ones I’ve met, think of themselves more as eternal learners. Every year, we’re presented with new people to learn, and they must study and do the best job they can of understanding these very intense and constantly changing minds and hearts. We do a little bit of teaching during the day and spend the rest of our time learning and reflecting. It’s not an exaggeration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe it’s impossible to capture all of this in a movie or TV show. Something of an episode nature is more focused on the short term hit, the payoff that happens within a few minutes or hours. Education is incompatible with this model and I wonder if the portrayal of teachers in TV/Movies is hurting the public perception of who teachers really are and what they do.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Universal Studios Revisited</title>

&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, I was in Orland for a work event, so I found some time with my colleagues to sneak off to Universal Studios. Mostly, I was interested in seeing Harry Potter World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking into the park, I felt the exact same way I did as a kid: completely excited and ready for some kind of adventure. I remembered, in the back of my mind, how &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; the rides felt… how it felt like you were actually in whatever movie was being modeled, how there was actual fire, and water spraying and…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I remembered, in the back of my mind, how &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; the rides felt… how it felt like you were actually in whatever movie was being modeled, how there was actual fire, and water spraying and…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting into Harry Potter world took me through Diagon Alley… and it really felt like I was right there in the books. Even the shops were done perfectly. Olivander’s wand shop had an amazing variety of wooden wands that had electronic sensors built in so kids could aim them at windows in the park and get ghostly figures to appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lines to get into the rides were spectacular. In the Gringott’s ride, there were animatronic bank tellers that would occasionally look up at you. It felt eerie and wonderful. The walls looked like they were covered in actual gold, and the sound effects were immersive. The references to the book were all around us and there were palpable excitement in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting on the rides was exciting. You get strapped in to something that looks a lot like a roller coaster seat, and then you’re whisked away into a dark cavern…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…and you end up in front of a screen. You then watch a sequence from what could maybe pass as a Harry Potter TV show (complete with the real actors from the movie), with a script that includes Voldemort shouting things he would never say in the books. Things like “I’ll get you, Harry Potter!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you watch a sequence, you’re whisked away to another screen. Same idea, different stupid plot, sometimes in 3D. This was pretty much all the rides, except for a wooden roller coaster that contained an animatronic Hippogriff (we didn’t ride this one because the line was too long).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was left wanting more. That same magic that I felt drinking butter beer in the park or wanting to buy a wand or a prank from the Weasley gift shop… that’s what I wanted in the main event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made it to a couple of other rides before the park closed, including ET, which hasn’t been updated since the 80’s. In ET, the entrance is way less decorated than the Harry Potter rides – just a screen showing a clip of Spielberg talking about the movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual ride puts you on a bike on a track that flies over various scenes from the movie. No screens. Just moving animatronic pieces, and a miniature cityscape that makes you feel like you’re actually flying above a city. And I remember some of the other, older rides were like this as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jaws ride had actual fire, that you could feel on your face. A bump underneath the boat and a great actor made you feel like there was trouble at sea. In the Earthquake or Disaster ride, you actually feel like the subway station’s ceiling is breaking, and there’s a bus headed right for your trolley. In King Kong, you’re faced with a gigantic replica of King Kong, with beautiful marble eyes that left you haunted as you left the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Harry Potter world was immersive and beautiful, the rides just showed us the same thing we’re always looking at. A screen. And one that is playing not so great content. Who wants that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ET on the other hand gave an all around immersive and magical experience. I assume that the reason for the screens on the newer rides is that it’s much cheaper to do… but man, it takes away the fun of a theme park like Universal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I could give advice to the people at Universal it would be this: magic and wonder aren’t cheap. They aren’t always the result of efficiency. If you’ve lost the magic and wonder in your product, consider looking where you last left it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Privilege That Keeps Us Sane</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sanity is fleeting these days. I feel it. You probably feel it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of this discomfort seems to do with a certain balance between certainty and uncertainty. On one hand, predictability and routine make us feel safe and comfortable. Maybe it’s the 30-something in me, but I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; waking up and feeling like I can predict what will happen in my day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, one of the first things I learned when I became a teacher is how much kids love routine. Truth is, people love routine… it just needs to be explicitly stated that kids love routine because it’s up to adults to set that routine. Adult routines are fairly self-working given our societal structure. Mealtimes are set, recreational time is set (after COB), work time is set (9-5), and weekends are our wildcards.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But all of this would be very boring without uncertainty. Crazy news stories, personal anecdotes that are extraordinary, illness, death, tragedy… all become the blips, waves, and tsunamis in the otherwise boring day-to-day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we stay sane, surfing between the certain and the uncertain. Too much certainty and we’re doomed to boredom. Too much uncertainty and we’re constantly in a tailspin, fending for our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This balance, of course, is a privilege. There are families and individuals who don’t have a predictable day-to-day. And the stress associated with that kind of life is what proves to me how much humans need it, and how life can be so unfair and inequitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get really excited when I see actual artists, or even portrayals of artists, using techniques that I use myself to produce art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed this as I was watching The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel on Amazon. I loved that she carries around a notebook to capture ideas as she sees them. It doesn’t matter what the context is. She could be on the subway, getting her nails done, with her friends… her brain is constantly on a low grade search for new inputs to turn into material. It reminded me of the process I’ve documented before on how I use the iOS app &lt;a href=&#34;getdrafts.com&#34;&gt;Drafts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Clearly the show’s writers have similar techniques that they use to capture ideas for the show. At least, I imagine they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick Capture is a technique that is also covered in the life-changing book Getting Things Done by David Allen. It made me realize that the thoughts we have are so fleeting, regardless of if they excite us while we’re having them. Most “million dollar ideas” aren’t ever written down, or even typed into the notes app on a phone. Certainly, action is how you get things done… but quick capturing your thoughts enables action.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can change what foods you eat, and it will have at least some kind of impact on your life. You might feel that you have more energy, that you’re happier, that your mood has improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can change the type of material you read online. Certain social networks have been shown to have negative impact on mental health. You might find that you judge yourself less harshly when compared to others, and you have less of an urge to get into arguments with strangers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;You can change the internal voice that your mind hears. You might find you’re easier on yourself, that you see yourself as a human, complete with facets and flaws. You might find you get closer to achieving your goals because you aren’t stopping yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Distinction Between Journaling Reflecting And Pontificating</title>

&lt;p&gt;Many people use a journal to “reflect.” But when I reflect, it’s not the semi-literal interpretation of looking at myself as I am now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a clear distinction between pontificating and reflecting, for me. When I write in this blog, I pontificate. Often, the writing is just my process for thinking. I have a very small idea of what I believe when I start a piece, and a much more complete version by the time I’m done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;There’s a clear distinction between pontificating and reflecting, for me. When I write in this blog, I pontificate. Often, the writing is just my process for thinking. I have a very small idea of what I believe when I start a piece, and a much more complete version by the time I’m done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, reflection is setting up systems to review &lt;em&gt;previous pontifications&lt;/em&gt;. I use a journal app called Day One to do this, but I’ve used other ones over the years (The Little Memory, OhLife, etc). Every day, I make a log of my big thoughts or things I’ve done that day no matter how mundane, and I look back on the prior year’s entries from today’s date (I have 7 years worth of data at this point).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m seeing myself as I once was, so that I can understand where my path has taken me. It also allows me to understand a better way to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, maybe I find that, in a piece of writing a year ago, I’m upset about how much I eat, and that nothing has changed in a year. But I also notice that I’ve switched jobs in that time, so it’s more about clinging to habits than it is environmental. This gives me a clue as to how to break the pattern… that is, stop waiting for a different environment to magically fix your habitual issues – start now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or it’s like how I used to think I’d be happier when I had more money and owned a house. Looking back on previous entries, it’s clear to me that I am not happier or sadder now that I have more money and own a house; the frustrations come and go as they always have. I do find I cling to them less, and that’s useful information as well. Maybe it’s aging, or maybe it’s the practice of journaling… it’s hard to say, but it gives me more clues than I would have otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple way to think of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journaling – in the moment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pontificating – gaining a better understanding of the moment to inform future choices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting – gaining perspective through the distance between now and some time ago&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three elements, when used in concert, keep me sane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard a metaphor the other day – that all the messages you’re sent as a child are like colored dye being put into a clear glass of water. They might all be different colors, but they blend together to create the unique image you have of yourself as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the same is true for artists, except we can expand this to cover every piece of media we consume. Every book, movie, TV episode, webisode, podcast, and blog post wedges itself, even in a small and subtle way, somewhere in our psyche.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was with a person a few decades older than me recently and we were talking about technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t you think,” she asked me, “that technology is making us more isolated? We have all these friends who aren’t really our friends.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always though that this argument doesn’t really hold much water. Most of the people I know, from any generation, still hang out face to face with their friends. It’s just that they communicate more frequently with them. And as for the gigantic network of barely-know-you acquaintances, that has its own problems, but it doesn’t make me want to see people in person less.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Another friend said: “There’s so much lost in a digital conversations, particularly the body language and nuances of tone. I could say the same thing online and in-person to you and you might receive it differently.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with that. My thinking is that we either then need to make sure that when we’re talking online, we’re saving the important stuff for in-person conversation. The result of not doing this is a YouTube comment war, or an endless Facebook argument in which no opinion is changed (in other words, a waste of hot air).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we need to learn to converse better over text and email. One thing I’ve noticed that I’m good at is maintaining relationships with people who are far away using nothing but the Messages app on my phone. And it has to do with the fact that I type a lot, and I type in detail, if I choose to have a conversation over text. And in fact, I will choose not to have a conversation over text if I can’t achieve this level of depth. It requires the other person to be game, as well. Most people text as if they’re trying to type as few characters as possible. And perhaps some people still have a data plan that limits them and that’s understandable as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m reading a very persuasive book right now called &lt;em&gt;10 Arguments to Delete Your Social Media Right Now&lt;/em&gt; by Jaron Lanier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lanier makes some really interesting points about the dangers of social media, things that I didn’t consider before. But what I noticed, and what Jaron points out, is that all of the dangers are related to the behavior of humans, not the behavior of technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook advertisers, he claims, are less like advertisers and more like behavior modification experts. This type of manipulation can be really dangerous – especially when a third party decides they want to shape a political mindset. He also argues it brings out everyone’s inner troll because the only real way to gain power online is through attention, and the most efficient way to gain attention is to be an asshole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe it’s not that we need to keep our kids away from technology (though we should definitely prevent them from getting addicted). Maybe we should teach them how to communicate better, both in-person and online, and also to know when each type of communication is appropriate for a given circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we don’t have a technology problem. Maybe it’s a people problem.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Not So Hidden Meaning Of Recreation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recreation is a word to which we’ve assigned a cultural meaning. It usually indicates fun or leisurely activities. Recreation centers are places to relax and exercise. In some schools, it has replaced the word “recess.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But recreation, or the act of &lt;em&gt;re-creation&lt;/em&gt;, might give us more than what we’ve taken from the word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to re-create one’s self. Play, something that usually happens during re-creation, can sometimes allow for healing and rebuilding. Exercise and stress release, stuff you’d find in a “rec” center, also serve the same purpose.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Simplest Way To Meditate</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was at a class on meditation once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instructor started by saying that meditation was easy. That if anyone in the room was intimidated by the idea of meditating, he was about to tell us something that would make the process much more simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every thought that crosses your mind,” he said, “can be labelled as &lt;em&gt;past, present, or future.&lt;/em&gt; Past thoughts are memories of things that have happened, and future thoughts are thoughts about what is going to happen. If you label the thought &lt;em&gt;past&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;future&lt;/em&gt;, then it can be archived, like email that is no longer important. There’s no use dwelling on those thoughts since they’ve already happened or haven’t yet happened.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There’s no use dwelling on those thoughts since they’ve already happened or haven’t yet happened.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Present thoughts are about things that are happening right now. Usually, they’re objective. I feel an itch. The room is too bright. I can hear piano playing, etc. They are present and not past because you haven’t had time to judge them. It’s impossible to be in a present thought and judge it at the same time, because then it becomes a past thought.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Take the present thoughts,” he continued, “you just touch them to your face like a feather. Feel them if you need to. And then they become past thoughts. Label them and move on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night, I went home and dreamt about a physical water-stream of time, flowing down a beautiful hill. And at the top were my future thoughts that I couldn’t see yet, down at the bottom in a well were my past thoughts, and I was running my hands through the water of the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure I’ll ever feel what it’s like to be enlightened. But this dream may have come close.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What I Mean When I Say Brilliant</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my Twitter profile, my bio line is “noticing brilliance since ’85.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People use this word as slang sometimes to mean “cool” or “smart” or “interesting.” My understanding of the word is a bit more specific and aligned to the literal definition of the word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be brilliant is to emit light, to be bright, or to be radiant. There are so many things that I would classify as brilliant that may not seem particularly “smart.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;When I wake up at my in-laws’ condo, they are usually up making an incredible smelling breakfast. I can smell the coffee from the bedroom and the general warmth from the entire experience is palpable. Brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kindness I see from the kids I work with, the random acts just because. There’s a brightness to this, a light that emanates beyond the circumstances. Brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversations I have with friends and family, the ones that hit me with a sudden epiphany, or a new way of thinking about an old problem. There’s a reason they call these “light bulb moments.” Brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have this song and the lyrics are “the stars will die after you and I, oh but love is brilliant.” The stars are the most well lit objects eyes can see, and still, it’s the love and legacy and insight that people leave behind that I find to be even more brilliant than any celestial body in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>This Is Why You Post More On Instagram Stories</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2018-10-13-this-is-why-you-post-more-on-instagram-stories/</link>

&lt;p&gt;Both Snapchat and YouTube are video sites. Both allow every day users to upload original content. And there are some differences between the two, like, the videos on Snapchat can only be 15 seconds and disappear after a while, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s a big difference in the design of these sites/apps that is worth noting. When you load YouTube, the first thing you see is a bunch of content to consume that might be relevant to your interests. With Snapchat, the first thing you see is your camera.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In order to get content on YouTube, you have to plan it out. There’s a process. You cut a video, which takes some level of skill, and then you have to find the place on the site to upload it. None of this is particularly difficult, but it does provide some friction in the creation process. To sit back and watch videos on YouTube takes no effort at all and can completely suck you in. And sure, you could record a video on your phone and upload it directly to YouTube, but you still have to fill out a form that gives it a title and tags, and most people don’t use YouTube so spontaneously. Even with the most off the cuff videos, there’s still some friction that could cause a person to say, “ya know what? This is too tedious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snapchat, or InstaStories, on the other hand, have no friction in the creation process. The bar is low – 15 seconds is super easy, and since it will disappear quickly, I don’t feel the type of pressure that the permanence of a YouTube video might bring on. There are people that create all sorts of video content on Instagram and Snapchat that would otherwise refrain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drafts, an app for iOS, works like this too. In most writing apps, you have to go through a lot of hoops just to get to the writing part. You have to click into a folder, or maybe a “new document” button or you have to find your previous document and then scroll to the bottom, etc… Drafts just opens a text editor. You type your content, and THEN decide where it goes through a series of custom actions. A little bit of investment on the front end with Drafts, but the payoff is that you can produce much more with less friction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Drafts app lives on my dock and I use it for anything that requires a bit of writing on my phone. I then have custom actions set up to specify where the text should go. For instance, I have a running list of things to talk about with my therapist. If a thought occurs to me, I open Drafts and can immediately capture what I’m thinking about. After I’m done, it’s two taps to hit my “Therapist” custom action which takes my text and puts it as a checkbox item at the very top of a running note in Evernote, which is saved to my shortcuts. I have Drafts actions for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Target runs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General to-dos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tweets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding lyrical ideas to my productivity system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems trivial but I believe the kind of old school friction in most creation apps prevents people from spreading their own ideas. I love the idea of an app that is strictly for sending your thoughts elsewhere, rather than being confronted by consumption material first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, I find it so much easier to consume than to create, but I find it so much more &lt;em&gt;fulfilling&lt;/em&gt; to create than consume.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How To Appreciate Anything</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2018-10-12-how-to-appreciate-anything/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was a high school kid, I was told My Bloody Valentine’s album Loveless would change my life. So I went to a record store in Georgetown, found a copy of it in the used bin, and went home to listen to it with some friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Those are guitars? Sounds like a vacuum cleaner,” one of my friends smirked. I couldn’t help but agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later, MBV’s album has become one of my favorites, and also one of the most influential albums on my own music. It wasn’t immediately accessible, and that taught me a valuable lesson about accessibility in art, nature, and people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;When I was a high school kid, I was told My Bloody Valentine’s album Loveless would change my life. So I went to a record store in Georgetown, found a copy of it in the used bin, and went home to listen to it with some friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Those are guitars? Sounds like a vacuum cleaner,” one of my friends smirked. I couldn’t help but agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later, MBV’s album has become one of my favorites, and also one of the most influential albums on my own music. It wasn’t immediately accessible, and that taught me a valuable lesson about accessibility in art, nature, and people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People, like music, can also have varying degrees of accessibility. They say first impressions are important, and they are, but that’s only because human beings are attempting to be super efficient with their judgment. We need to know if you’re going to help us or harm us, and we need to know quick. Similarly with music, we need to know if the piece we’re listening to is going to fulfill us over the long term, like our favorite all-time records, or if it will be a waste of time, and we’ll wish we had those minutes or hours back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First impressions are everything&lt;/em&gt;, the saying goes. That’s also where the saying stops. What MBV taught me is that first impressions &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be everything, but only if the person on the receiving end of that impression isn’t curious enough to learn more about your angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And impressions themselves are just partial information. An impression of a foot in the sand may let us know that someone walked on the beach, but it doesn’t say much about the beauty of the sunset reflecting on the ocean. That takes inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that MBV record taught me to inquire. I wondered why someone would tell me that a piece of music is life-changing if I wasn’t able to immediately understand it, on first impression. The same thing happened with Jeff Buckley’s Grace and Brian Eno’s Music for Airports. I started to look at all the angles and noticed that underneath that wall of guitars, there was melody, and there was meaning. There was a piece that I was able to connect with, but it took work to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lost in Translation is my favorite movie for that exact reason. The pearl of that movie is hidden deep within its hazy aesthetic. The impression it leaves you with is almost unsatisfactory, but it’s just interesting enough to make you want to inquire further. The same be said, of course, about The Room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And The Room, arguably one of the worst movies of all time, is appreciated by many. So appreciated, in fact, that James Franco went as far as to make a movie about the movie. So you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; appreciate anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find anything. A piece of music, a film, a cartoon, a painting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a first impression. Do you like it? Hate it? Does it make you feel anything?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inquire. What happens when you listen to or view it again, but this time in a different room or at a different time of day, when the light is just peaking over the clouds at sunset?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens when you write a paragraph about what it might mean?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens after a week of exposing yourself to it every day?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How have your feelings changed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson, maybe, is that you can appreciate anything by getting to know it deeply. Every thing we encounter makes us feel something. We connect in some way, even if it’s subtle, and even if it’s not positive. That piece had a purpose in our lives. It taught us something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the people I love the most in my life weren’t people I thought I’d appreciate that much on our first conversation. It took getting to know them, seeing their angles, eating linguine with them, encountering an unexpected adventure, etc. to really have a breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be you, with a mundane sandwich, tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You really never know.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Overindulgence</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everything in moderation, including moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure who said it originally, but my father-in-law is the one who mentioned this to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overindulgence is such a funny game. On one hand, it’s a mirror of addiction principles. The first bite of something sweet, the first toke, the first sip, whatever it is… is usually the best turn you’ll take with the indulgence. After that? It’s just an action repeat, on loop, until it’s impossible to continue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It’s just an action repeat, on loop, until it’s impossible to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overindulgence is a fun activity in which I sometimes participate with friends. No, we don’t drink ourselves into a stupor or do anything dangerous. Mostly it’s food. But it’s an unspoken bonding ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing about overindulgence is that it teaches you the same lesson every single time: there are diminishing returns when you continue to indulge. Yet, we never seem to be able to turn it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what Charles Duhigg (Power of Habit) tells us is that it all comes down to the fact that overindulgence is a habit that is stored in the brain’s basal ganglia (an operating system for habits, I suppose). If we were to just change the cue (don’t invite friends over) or the routine (do something other than eating) or the reward (order something healthier but still tasty at the restaurant) we might be able to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But who has time for dissecting habits when there’s a plate of fries around?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Music That Was Once An Antidote Revisiting Emo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I put on some old records that I enjoyed in my high school and college days the other day. I wanted to introduce some of these bands to my son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now admittedly, it had been a while since I had listened to these albums. They could be described as: punk, emo, punk pop, ska, etc. I still know every word, and even the track order of most of the albums.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Now admittedly, it had been a while since I had listened to these albums. They could be described as: punk, emo, punk pop, ska, etc. I still know every word, and even the track order of most of the albums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was total shit. It made me wonder how I ever liked that music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It hadn’t been &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; long since I had listened to these albums. But my tastes have definitely changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emo music has chords that, when they lock in just right with the rest of the band, and they’re played at high speeds and high distortion and high volumes… provide just the right antidote for an angsty teen. For a minute, you feel like someone understands. Like some mohawk sporting scientists found a way to take all that rage you have trapped inside of your bones and turn it into sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that, just by confronting those sounds, you are confronting your anger, and thereby soothing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m no longer angry at the world. I haven’t been since probably my mid to late 20’s. So now all that anger and rage sounds unpleasant. I’m not looking at myself anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, there was a time where I was heavy into ambient music, like Brian Eno’s Music For Airports (still a favorite) but other artists in the genre, like Christopher Willits and Ryuichi Sakamoto. I’d listen to full ambient white noise albums on the way to work in the morning (a 60-90 min commute).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time in my life, I felt a lot of my work was meaningless. There was no message really. There wasn’t much time to think about how meaningless the work was either. Days, months and years just kind of drifted by like clouds until I one day decided to leave my career altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no wonder the ambient music spoke to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, it was like I was being confronted with my inner self, and I could reflect and see my innermost desires. It took a while. But ambient music was part of the antidote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And these days, I’m more interested in creating music than listening to it. Even the stuff I do listen to feels more like a study of how I could re-create it than it is a pure reflection experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what I’m going through. Future me will parse it out in a later post, I’m sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get confused and amused at some vegan and vegetarian recipes that show up on the internet. Usually it’s some kind of listicle about going meatless, some kind of challenge to get people to get less animal products, or sometimes less carbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples: White bean meatballs, no cheese cheeseburgers, eggplant bacon, cauliflower rice, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not against eating more vegetables or less carbs. In fact, plant based is my default (but I’m not strict enough to call myself a vegan).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But some of these recipes go too far in their effort to engage potential meat loving converts. It’s the same with things like zucchini noodles, or tofurkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feeling I get when I eat these foods is… I wish I was eating the real thing. I wish it was real cheese, real burger meat, real noodles. I’m getting a cheap substitute. I’m getting ripped off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s a much harder task to sell someone on eating salad or isolated vegetables. But that’s what would work on me; eating as a mindful and nourishing routine, rather than a way to just get full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d rather enjoy the succulent tenderness of a kiwi than eat a fake meatball. Much rather have seasoned and cooked brussel sprouts than zucchini that kind of resembles noodles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m anti-imitation and pro-alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same goes for music and movies and all art, really. I love Bon Iver, but loathe Bon Iver imitators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d rather immerse myself in a genre I don’t particularly care for if I’m listening to an innovator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t you?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Benefits Of A Haircut</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time, I didn’t care much about getting a haircut, or cutting my nails before they got really long, or shaving every day. I actually got pretty upset if someone told me I needed a haircut… like, actually, I don’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; your &lt;em&gt;shit&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, at some point in my mid-20’s, I became hyper-aware of my body. If my beard got just a little too long, it would become unbearable and scratchy and if I was out at dinner I’d rush home to shave it. It came on out of nowhere, seemingly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I started to agree with all those comments about “you really need a haircut.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so now, when I sit down in the barber’s chair, I take note of how I’m feeling before and after the deed is done. Before, there is hair on my neck, my sideburns are sticking out making my face wider, and after…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel free. It’s almost like all the hair that accumulated on my skin in the past however long also allowed feelings to accumulate. Little tiny paper cuts, losses, wins, joys, fears… over the course of 20 minutes, all on the tile floor to be swept away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it that really that easy to start over?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is the start, but not the end, of the way forward. Experiencing sadness, anger, and fear are normal and &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be experienced in a balanced life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The low hum of general cynicism, however, can be permanently deafening. Like a pit that becomes harder and harder to crawl out of, the deeper we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard before that the world will eventually heal; once humans have gone extinct, the planet will heal herself and repair all of the ways in which we have damaged her.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Barack Obama said that we are the change we’ve been waiting for. Remember that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must view the world as a place that can heal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, we must settle for nothing less.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I Wish My Son Came With An Instruction Manual</title>

&lt;p&gt;It occurrs to me, after the birth of my son two weeks ago, that he did not come with an instruction manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An instruction manual has always been an integral part in the learning process for anything I interact with. Written instructions on the set up, the maintenance, the care, the features… are usually covered in some kind of booklet. My son came with no such booklet. Therefore, I struggle to understand his operation. It can be frustrating at times, but occasionally when I know how to get the parameters just right, it can also be incredibly joyful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Therefore, I struggle to understand his operation. It can be frustrating at times, but occasionally when I know how to get the parameters just right, it can also be incredibly joyful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the local experts who had acquired a baby previously claimed to know exactly how my son operates, but following their instructions was a bit like using graffiti to learn long division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it occurs to me that perhaps my son doesn’t have an instruction manual because manuals are written to describe products that are static. A TV might display infinite images over the course of its life, but its operation remains the same throughout. Furthermore, a TV was created more or less to solve a specific problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My son, on the other hand, wasn’t created to solve a specific problem. In fact, the act of solving specific problems is inherent to the idea of good design, and we definitely did not design him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s more like he is designing himself, with every hiccup, glance, and arm stretch. Whatever elements he sees when he looks out of our kitchen window gets imprinted right onto his heart like a tattoo, and every meaningless word I sing to him translates into warmth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no manual for a product that is still being crafted. There’s no specific set of problems he’s solving yet, outside of simply surviving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specific problem is what college students search for. It’s the thing that takes most people forever to figure out. It takes time and errors and sweat and vomit and blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s silly for me to even expect a manual for something so simple. But me, on the other hand… I’ve taken that time. I’ve made those errors. I’ve sweat until my pores were clogged, and I’ve vomited until I was empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose if he could, my son would complain that it is ludicrous that I, his father, don’t come with an instruction manual. After all, I exist to solve a specific set of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after all, little boys often have trouble understanding how their fathers operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so this repository of text files that I call a blog, the collection of melodies and lyrics that I call my songs, and everything else that I put my name on will become the instruction manual. So that when I’m tired and soaked in rain and there are moments that he doesn’t get me and I don’t get him, at least there will be words on the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least there will be some semblance of a manual, of &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least he can start to understand the specific problems I was designed to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe, just maybe, he can start to ask himself what specific problems he was designed to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Small Talk Vs Large Talk And Your Rich Inner Life</title>

&lt;p&gt;A message you’ll see a lot in social media is “you are loved.” But a blanket statement to a thousand friends looks nice on the surface and is relatively useless under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What matters is not what cover photo you have on your Facebook or Instagram. What matters is curiosity about those things that exist outside of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have this friend that I used to quietly observe while she had conversations with people. Whereas most people have small talk conversations that skate across the surface of life (where did you go on vacation? How’s your mom?), she would dig deeply into the very fibers of a person’s life story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

How’s your mom?), she would dig deeply into the very fibers of a person’s life story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’d ask questions that explore the person’s values, rather than just about the events in their life. By the end of the conversation, the person usually felt like they had been understood (no matter how minute of an understanding) and also that they understood themselves better due to verbalizing their thoughts and opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could learn from this practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much small talk misses the point of human connection. Conversation known as small talk is simply meant to pass time at a gathering. What’s the point? Having deeper conversations, ones that challenge us and help us to articulate our goals and our hopes and our dreams… those are the ones worth having.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sometimes it’s necessary to resort to the ease of small talk. There are some situations where “large” talk may not be appropriate. But there are many other situations where it could be, where there’s an opportunity for a deeper dive into someone’s psyche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no better way to act on the phrase “you are loved” than to be genuinely curious about someone else’s rich inner life. And there’s no better way to gain self-clarity than to expose your own richer inner life to another person.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The White Noise Paradox</title>

&lt;p&gt;I’m sensitive to sound. It’s always been this way. Vacuums, sirens, people talking during movies, loud noises coming from rooms/houses nearby late at night… all irritate my brain in ways that can’t be easily described. When I was an RA in college, the majority of my reports were noise violations. I’m sensitive to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that sensitivity runs both ways. The sound of vegetables sizzling in oil in a frying pan brings me intense amounts of joy. A good record does the same. The sound of my fingers typing on my MacBook Pro at this very moment, same thing. I can identify people’s voices easily, like when I saw Rogue One and heard Riz Ahmed’s voice and immediately knew he was the rapper from Swet Shop Boys.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;One weird thing I noticed though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, a podcast brought to my attention the idea of taking noise cancelling headphones on a flight to feel less anxious about the flight, that most anxiety on an airplane was a result of the unidentified sound. I ended up getting a pair and it changed my life. Now, I can’t fly without them. It’s not so much the beeping alert systems, but just the general growl of the plane. Without it, I’m a much happier camper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, a few months after that, when I was having trouble falling asleep, someone who knows me well and knows my sensitivity to sounds, recommended trying a white noise generator. The one that I got from Amazon has a fan inside; you turn it on and it whirs gently. You can increase the volume by lengthening the space where the sound comes through. I got back into a regular sleeping pattern as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s odd though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would artificial silence in the white noise environment of the airplane be relaxing, but the silence in my room at night be deafening enough to keep me awake?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do I crave stillness in a dynamic environment and movement in a serene environment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is that I’m looking at the wrong pattern. It’s the same way I don’t love the texture of olives until they’re soaked in vodka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, it’s more about the habit than it is the sensitivity to sounds. This revelation unlocks a lot of new possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penn Jilette (of Penn and Teller) says that when he lost 300 lbs, he ate nothing but potatoes for two weeks and it reset his taste buds. He said his unhealthy eating habits were not because he enjoyed unhealthy food more; rather, it was just his habit to eat food that wasn’t good for him. Changing the pattern seemingly changed his preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habits, that’s it. Nothing to be afraid of. Just your own brain making things easier and more difficult for you simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of my cousins live far away, so when it was the first time we’d seen each other in a while, there was always a bit of awkwardness. A moment or two of shyness, of hiding behind our parents legs… and then we’d participate in some activity that was really more like parallel play, and after that… pure bliss, as we discovered that, despite being a few years older than the last time, we were pretty much the same and could pick up exactly where we left off.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Last night, I was with some friends from middle school. I hadn’t seen these friends in nearly 20 years (we went to an international school in Cairo, Egypt).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This one friend,” I told my wife on the way there, “is super goofy. Though, then again, that was when she was twelve. I guess people probably change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it turns out she’s still silly. And all of the friends that I reconnected were almost exactly as I remember them (with a little more gray hair, and children). People change less than I thought. And relationships with those with whom we’ve had vivid and life-lasting memories… we pick up right where we left off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I brought a deck of cards with me. I figured that no one would remember that I constantly did magic when I was 13 as a way to make friends, but that if I didn’t bring a deck along with me, I’d be mad if there was a missed opportunity to perform (performance is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ziahassan.com/daily/magic-is-a-gift/&#34;&gt;gift&lt;/a&gt;). It was one of the first things that someone asked me about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So you’ve been doing magic all this time?” someone asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve gone in and out of it,” I replied. “I got self conscious at times. When you’re a kid and you think magic is the coolest thing ever, it doesn’t really occur to you that most of the world sees it as a pretty nerdy hobby.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend interrupted me and wildly exclaimed “you’ve got to own it! Be yourself!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was so blatant and obvious that made me stop in my tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve grappled with being myself for my entire life, as many people have. But the way that this friend put it, with such matter-of-factness (nearly frustration), it flipped my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, being yourself is the path of least resistance. And yet, we resist. But then we meet someone, someone we haven’t seen for a while, someone who knew us an insecure 13 year old trying to grapple with life’s mysteries… and although we’re now a grown-up, they still see that kid they knew. The one that sang for fun, made up songs, found your selected card, and goofed off in geography class. And they remind us: “I see you. I accept you. I love you the way you are. I love who you are. Now do me a huge favor…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Own it.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Celebrating The Need For A Maintenance List Or Being Responsible</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a very intricate to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s separated into multiple lists in the same database, each with their own project subdivision. The metadata on these task items also indicate a context, and the software I use allows me to filter tasks (the &lt;a href=&#34;http://omnigroup.com&#34;&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; refers to this as a ‘perspective’) by context and project. This allows me to really slice up my list and shorten it only to what can be accomplished during my work time, rather than be threatened by all of the things I &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; do at the moment. The metadata also contains an indication of how often a task should reoccur (and also an indication of whether recurrence is based on a particular day of the week, or relative to the last time the item was completed).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I distinctly remember, a few months ago, that I needed to add a recurring item to my list… which was “order new Sonicare toothbrush head on Amazon.” I had moved from categorizing primarily on context to categorizing by project (since the idea of a context is fleeting in this mobile everything world).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This item was not an errand, really, nor was it a creative task, or a task related to work. So, I created a new catch-all for these sorts of tasks and I called it &lt;em&gt;”maintenance.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the next few months, this list ballooned. I found myself adding to it item upon item. Things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take out the trash (recurs weekly on Tuesdays)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wipe down bathrooms (recurs every 1 week relative to completion date)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flip mattress (recurs every 6 months relative to completion)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test smoke detectors (monthly on the first day)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the catch-all project I didn’t know that I needed. A bucket for the things in my life that I need to do just to keep my head above water and make sure everything is functional. After I realized this was becoming my primary list, I started wondering if it had always been that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I always need so much maintenance? When I was a kid, a lot of it was taken care of by my parents. And when I moved out as a young 20-something, I didn’t care so much about taking out the trash or wiping bathrooms with regularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, no, I didn’t always need this much maintenance. The list has grown as I’ve gotten older. And the older I get, the more it will grow, I suspect. The last time I was this high maintenance, I was too young to understand the idea of lists. The next time I’ll be that high maintenance, I’ll most likely be too old to care about lists anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that this list now exists means I’m at a new era in my life. Creating it is an admission that there are layers to my life that I maybe haven’t looked at carefully enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I celebrate this list, too. After all, I want my son to have a father who can keep his shit together. And the maintenance keeps me healthy and sane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can finally give myself the structure that I’ve always craved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m 33 today but I can’t help wondering how I’ll feel about the maintenance list when I’m 43.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Because Im Standing Here</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another day, another lesson learned from tech support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, it’s the scenario that has played out so many times over both of my careers in tech: someone complains about a bug, or something that doesn’t work properly. I ask them to replicate it so I can see it happen. The person tries to replicate the issue, and this time, there’s no problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they always say this line: “it’s because you’re standing here!”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Another day, another lesson learned from tech support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, it’s the scenario that has played out so many times over both of my careers in tech: someone complains about a bug, or something that doesn’t work properly. I ask them to replicate it so I can see it happen. The person tries to replicate the issue, and this time, there’s no problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they always say this line: “it’s because you’re standing here!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a joke, of course. They don’t actually believe my presence made the issue work. But we examine the difference between the time it worked and the time it didn’t… and the difference is I was standing here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. I was standing here watching. And you know that you were being watched. And so you took yourself out of autopilot for a moment and paid attention to where your hands where, which options were ticked, which buttons were pressed. And whatever your autopilot brain made you do before that caused a malfunction, you avoided this time. And so it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s a lesson here, it’s probably that &lt;em&gt;paying attention&lt;/em&gt; is a tool that you can use when things don’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your kids won’t clean up their room like you asked? &lt;em&gt;Pay attention&lt;/em&gt; to the procedure. What steps happened to create this “malfunction?” You think you’re being strict, but you didn’t provide enough steps to make tidying a solid process and an autonomous habit. You knew this was important, but yelling at the kids was easier (and perhaps an autonomous habit for you).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t lose weight even though you’re dieting and working out? &lt;em&gt;Pay attention&lt;/em&gt; to the procedure. You think you’re eating healthy, but you didn’t count the sugar in your morning latte that added 250 calories. You ate a cookie after your run that was about 300 calories, when the run only burned 240 calories. You knew eating less was important, but you didn’t track every calorie meticulously. (Hint: food journaling and calorie counting are versions of paying attention).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accountability, that matters too. My watchful eye holds my tech user accountable in a non-accusatory way. Who’s watching what you’re watching? Who is paying attention to the things you’re not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to rely on our autopilot brains and then get frustrated when things don’t work out. What’s hard is paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the investment you make by paying attention? It pays off when your brain gets rewired and these changes become part of the habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A worthy investment, if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Choosing To Be Resilient</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2018-04-04-choosing-to-be-resilient/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//localhost:1313/posts/2018-04-04-choosing-to-be-resilient/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to think that a happy person was someone full of smiles. Someone who, upon hearing tragic news, would shrug it off and smell the roses. Someone who you couldn’t shatter with bad news. A happy person, to me, was invincible. And sometimes, you’ll hear this adage that you can &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; to be happy if you want to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But considering that in 33 years, I’ve never met such a person, perhaps we shouldn’t spread this idea of happiness being a choice. It’s too simple.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;I used to think that a happy person was someone full of smiles. Someone who, upon hearing tragic news, would shrug it off and smell the roses. Someone who you couldn’t shatter with bad news. A happy person, to me, was invincible. And sometimes, you’ll hear this adage that you can &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; to be happy if you want to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But considering that in 33 years, I’ve never met such a person, perhaps we shouldn’t spread this idea of happiness being a choice. It’s too simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, we’ve got our limbic system, which doesn’t care much about logical choices. And there are many tragic situations that &lt;em&gt;call for sadness&lt;/em&gt; as the appropriate response. And I have to believe that part of some people’s sadness comes from the idea that they &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be happy if they just wanted to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In school, teachers don’t teach kids to be happy. Instead, they teach them how to deal with their emotions appropriately. It’s interesting how rarely we practice what we teach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a healthier spiritual framework is to choose to be resilient. With this framework, you would &lt;em&gt;allow&lt;/em&gt; the entire spectrum of emotions to affect you. You would be fully immersed in the emotions for which a given situation calls… but you wouldn’t let your own emotions defeat you, or control your thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a word, you are &lt;em&gt;resilient&lt;/em&gt;. Resilience, contrary to popular belief, doesn’t mean letting things “slide off your back” or whatever. Have you ever met anyone who actually does that? Not just someone appears to do that, but someone who actually doesn’t care when bad things happen to them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably not. But you have met people who seem to steady the wheel in times of turbulence, despite their very blatant pain. People who care so deeply about what is happening around them, but they never (not even once) consider giving up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when tragedy strikes, big or small, what do you do? Two choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You let it get inside your head. You avoid talking to people at the dinner party for fear of bursting into tears. You go to bed plagued by the thought of more joy being undone, more shoes dropping, more people in your life with pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You lean in. You ask people how they are, how they really are. You smell the food at the table. You touch the placemat, marveling at how real it feels. You laugh, despite your pain, despite the tears that are on the verge of your eyelids. You keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resilience is a good gift to give to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s an even greater gift for those who surround you. I know I’ll forget this again the next time tragedy strikes, but for now, it’s on paper. Send this link back to me if I ever forget.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Overdeveloped Intuition Or The 20 Minute Rule</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2018-03-23-overdeveloped-intuition-or-the-20-minute-rule/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a website called &lt;a href=&#34;lmgtfy.com&#34;&gt;Let Me Google That For You&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a by-product of the way that many people solve problems. Specifically, that people are quick to assume that when they don’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; answers, the obstacles that need to be overcome in order to &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; answers are insurmountable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever someone asks you a question that can be easily googled, you’d go to LMGTFY, type in the search query and send the resulting link to your stumped friend. The friend will click on the link and watch animated instructions on how to google their question. It’s as insulting as it is clever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The friend will click on the link and watch animated instructions on how to google their question. It’s as insulting as it is clever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was an IT Consultant, I used to answer Level 2 (more advanced) help desk calls. When someone would call too frequently, I would sometimes pick up the phone and say “Hey! I’m actually running into a meeting right now for about 20 minutes. Could you call me back in 20?” This, of course, was a lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;95% of the time, the user had solved their own problem after 20 mins and either never called me back or sent me an email telling me everything was fixed. I dubbed this the 20 minute rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LMGTFY is probably more shaming than it is educational. But with the 20 minute rule, I like to think that I had taught the client more about how to solve tech problems than I would have if I walked them through the solution (only to have them waste their own time and call me back later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it’s not about Google. It’s about humans. Exploration, playing, iterating, creating, destroying… it’s inherent to how we’ve always operated as a species. It is these fundamental actions that have allowed us to even have Google in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When instinct says to call a friend the minute your printer dies, you may end up living a life of relying on others to solve problems with solutions that lie within your own mind. Like when an actor goes off script, or when you get lost without a cell phone signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of it as exercise for your intuition. The more you do it, the stronger your intuition becomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is resourcefulness if it isn’t just overdeveloped intuition?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Functional Dessert</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2018-03-22-functional-dessert/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In most restaurants, dessert is the thing they try to push on you after you’ve already eaten a big meal. So you have your ice cream, or pie a la mode, and then collapse into a big heap on your bed while contemplating going on a diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese restaurants give the same dessert with every meal, for the most part: a fortune cookie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, the cookie isn’t even that sweet. The joy of eating it doesn’t last very long.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It’s the words on the little slip of paper inside that nourishes us. The little piece of random advice that seeps its way into our mind as we go about our week. A provocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve written before about how things like fortunes, horoscopes, and lucky numbers help us pay attention. They’re somewhat random and meaningless out of context, but it’s our mind that makes the meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if fortune cookies allow us to focus our attention by way of some random thought scribbled on the piece of paper inside, then they offer something no other dessert does… insight.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mastery Isnt A Ladder Its A Safari</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was a teacher in DC, one of my very favorite students came up to me and she was really excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mr. Hassan,” she said, “Ms. Eisele just gave me my reading assessment… I got to reading level Y! That means if I increase my reading level by one more letter, I will get to level Z! That’s the last level!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s great!” I told her. “You must have worked really hard and read a lot of books at home.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;When I was a teacher in DC, one of my very favorite students came up to me and she was really excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mr. Hassan,” she said, “Ms. Eisele just gave me my reading assessment… I got to reading level Y! That means if I increase my reading level by one more letter, I will get to level Z! That’s the last level!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s great!” I told her. “You must have worked really hard and read a lot of books at home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah!” she said. “And,” she added gleefully, “once I reach the last level, I won’t ever have to read a book again!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that they’ve been given the impression by adults that mastery is a ladder. That all you have to do is keep climbing. That once you’ve reached the top of the ladder, you’ve achieved mastery. The mastery game we play with kids is more about the what and the how than it is about the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we want to be a proficient reader? It’s not to get to the next reading level – it’s so that we can quickly and efficiently learn new things about the world to solve problems or to express our original ideas. Reading a text about the rock cycle isn’t very meaningful if it doesn’t make us stop and think the next time we pick up a stone on the playground. Comprehending a text about the revolutionary war doesn’t mean anything unless we connect it to the problems of economic inequality that exist in today’s world. Mastery is not a ladder, it’s a safari! Project based learning – active exploration of real-world challenges and problems. I was once told by an administrator, STOP letting kids play with rocks in your geology reading lessons – you’re a &lt;em&gt;reading&lt;/em&gt; teacher, NOT a science teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried an experiment a few years ago when I was applying for a teaching job at numerous schools in DC. At the end of my interview, when the administrators asked me if I had any other questions, I asked them what project have you seen a student engage in, that has amazed you, that has challenged your own thinking, or that has provided something useful to the community. I wanted to hear how students were &lt;em&gt;connecting&lt;/em&gt; their skills to the world around them, a world that they are desperately trying to understand and heal. The answer I got most of the time was… that their favorite project was … kids growing their reading levels. And that is a fundamental skill and so important – but it isn’t a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have the courage to allow students to use what they’ve learned with their reading and math skills to change the world today, even in a small way, then we are preparing them to be leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cannot afford to settle for anything less.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Two Favorite Parts Of Ladybird</title>

title = &amp;ldquo;02&amp;rdquo;
date = 2018
+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoilers ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First: The part where everyone is complimenting and congratulating the performers at the school play on the way out, and the drama teacher says quietly “They didn’t get it.” We later find out that he’s depressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just loved this part so much as an artist. The accolades you receive a lot of times are merely supportive. Supportive is not bad (and actually welcome!) but you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; when someone has connected with what you’ve made when they become emotional.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;When Ladybird tells her mom that she wishes her mom &lt;em&gt;liked&lt;/em&gt; her, I think she felt a bit like the drama teacher felt about the play. I don’t feel like you get me. You’re in support of me (“of course I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; you!”), you want me to be the best version of myself, but I don’t feel that you really cherish who I am &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;. You don’t see my finer details. You don’t see the work I’m doing to be where I am right now (“what if this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the best version of myself?”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You don’t get me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how appropriate is it to learn such a complicated lesson as a teenager? That distinction between people &lt;em&gt;getting you&lt;/em&gt; and people merely being supportive of you? Anyone who has ever dared to publish, create, or put themselves in front of an audience with something totally original knows this distinction. In this film, Ladybird is her own piece of art as a human, from the color of her hair, or the attention to getting the right prom dress, right down to giving herself a name, and lamenting occasionally over the fact that we just adhere to the name our parents give us without any real contemplation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think when she calls her parents at the end and refers to herself as Christine (“a good name”), she’s admitting to them… maybe I didn’t get &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe she realizes: I’m my own piece of art, but I’m also the byproduct of my parents. I’m their creation as much as I am my own, in a different way. And when her mom drives away from the airport in tears, you realize how true this is. It wasn’t the lying or the hiding of information, it was just the pure sadness of her daughter, someone she does in fact like, leaving to go to college. My mom got a bit like this when I left (even though I didn’t go very far).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second favorite part of lady bird was the phone call to her mom at the end. When she talks being emotional driving in Sacramento. How the roads and shops she’d always known look and feel completely different now that she’s in the driver’s seat. She realizes what being a child means, or what it means to straddle childhood and adulthood simultaneously as high school senior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the perfect ending to the movie because it hands to you the emotions of both parties; Ladybird and her parents. It’s unresolved, intentionally, like a wistful song. It makes you realize, as the Pop Culture Happy Hour put it, that this movie is as much about her parents as it is about her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved Ladybird but I’m glad not every movie makes me feel this way. One movie like this per season and I’m good. It’s just enough to remember what it’s important without it becoming background noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was watching Gordon Ramsey on YouTube, and he said that one should never put anything into a pan that isn’t hot enough to sizzle. And ever since I’ve adopted this way of thinking, I’ve enjoyed cooking about 1000% more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feeling that I get when the food drops from my hand into the pan and immediately starts to sweat and get aromatic is indescribable. It’s gotten to the point at which cooking using a frying pan turns into a little ritual for me, with music playing the lighting set perfectly in the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;When I have to use the stove, I’m far less excited. Magic that is visual is more pleasurable than when it’s contained in a black box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the pan, it’s the smell and sound of the garlic and onion that I like the most. It’s like a bass line because it grooves. The rest of the ingredients are the chords. The garnish is a melody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe cooking is the key to insight.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I Get A Tarot Reading Every Month Seriously</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every month, I watch a YouTube channel where a guy named Nick in an unidentified part of the world reads my tarot. And every month, I learn about what to expect in regard to my health, wealth, and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He does this by pulling random cards out of a shuffled tarot deck and interpreting what they might mean. And actually, sometimes he doesn’t even pull the cards; instead, he’ll occasionally be clumsy while shuffling and a card will fall out and he’ll use that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Every month, I watch a YouTube channel where a guy named Nick in an unidentified part of the world reads my tarot. And every month, I learn about what to expect in regard to my health, wealth, and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He does this by pulling random cards out of a shuffled tarot deck and interpreting what they might mean. And actually, sometimes he doesn’t even pull the cards; instead, he’ll occasionally be clumsy while shuffling and a card will fall out and he’ll use that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he arranges the cards in a spread. In the center of the spread, there’s a catalyst card (bear in mind this could be any card in the deck), that provides a theme for the reading, and then all of the other cards are used in context of the catalyst. For instance, my catalyst card this month was centered around the idea of perseverance. Therefore, even though there were other cards in the spread that may have meant various things, he interpreted these cards through the lens of “perseverance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, of course, when Nick tells my “fortune,” he’s not actually predicting events that will take place in my life. He’s not looking into the future or doing anything mystical. There are no physical descriptions of people I might meet. No promises of me suddenly inheriting some large sum of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do this reading willingly, knowing full well that it has nothing to do with celestial bodies. Knowing full well that the cards he selects were not divinely chosen in any way. They just happened to be what shook out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, when Nick reads my tarot, he’s simply looking at a bunch of random pictures and using those pictures as inspiration for an improvisatory narrative. And then I find a way to make that narrative fit my life story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s moving. And it’s what &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; great art does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great art provides the narrative. We provide the meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great art provides the key. We provide the lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So each month, I subject myself to this fascinatingly creative piece of art on YouTube, and then I make his narrative fit my life story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still get taken by surprise every day, of course. The difference is that after my reading, &lt;em&gt;I’m better at paying attention.&lt;/em&gt; I’m better at filtering out the meaningless events from the meaningful ones (because that can be tricky). I &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; spend recklessly, eat total garbage, overreact to mildly bad news, and forget to call my mom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no rainbow, not pot of gold, and the stars don’t align, exactly…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…but at least on this cold February night, I’m aware that they’re there, twinkling faintly in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Burn Freely</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had dinner with a friend tonight. Someone I respect that I once reached out to interview for a podcast, and then reconnected with randomly in my new job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked about a lot of things. But mostly we talked about our careers, and why we choose to work in education. Eventually, we moved into reasons why people choose the work that they do in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked about my regrets, my struggles, my pride, and my failures as a teacher. I talked about what I need in my job to be happy, to be productive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I talked about my regrets, my struggles, my pride, and my failures as a teacher. I talked about what I need in my job to be happy, to be productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned how I’ve started thinking lately that “follow your passion” is [bad advice][1]. That we should do the things we’re good at, and take pride in our competencies, rather than chasing after flames that may or may not work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She stopped me and said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Maybe it’s not bad advice. Maybe it’s incomplete advice. Maybe it’s not about following. Maybe it’s about gathering. Being passionate is like being on fire. You just need to find an environment where you can &lt;em&gt;burn freely&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what does it mean to &lt;em&gt;burn freely&lt;/em&gt;? I don’t know, but perhaps it’s:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;being an environment where you can be yourself without much judgment;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;surrounding yourself with like-minded people;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wearing your beliefs and passions on your sleeve and being open to change but firm in your confidence;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allowing others to burn freely too and stoking their flames as much as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stronger fire spreads more quickly, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Magic Is A Gift</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m a magician. I’ve learned, performed and created magic for the past 26 years or so. I can’t remember a family gathering where I didn’t have a deck of cards on hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started when my grandmother made a coin disappear, right in front of my eyes. I don’t think she used any sleight of hand (I was 4 or so). In fact, I’m pretty sure she just distracted me and dropped the coin into the cushions of the couch we were sitting on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But that was the start of my fascination with magic. The gigantic tomes with hundreds of methods. The pamphlets with math magic scrawled inside. The magic shops that were much more abundant back then, with their jam packed shelves of god-knows-what… a mix of pranks, gaffs, gimmicks, and secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I performed at family parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One uncle that prided himself in figuring out puzzles, would pull me aside after I completed a trick to tell me exactly how it was done. Everyone else probably knew too back then, but he was the one who made sure I knew that the moments of magic I’d been experiencing were more about the novelty of a kid doing magic, rather than disbelief or astonishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the first time I did a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; strong trick at one of these parties. It was called the invisible deck (and it utilizes one of the most creative and popular principles in card magic). I performed it for my bubble bursting uncle at a wedding. He had many guesses as to how it worked, but for the first time in my life, I noticed a perplexed look on his face. He eventually gave up, told me I did a good job with that one, and walked away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He and I both remember that moment vividly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For him, a guy who was always able to analyze and figure out patterns and methods, he had received a moment that he couldn’t explain. And I don’t know if he’d describe it as pleasurable, but it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for me, I’d learned what it was like to truly astonish someone. To leave them without any explanation. To make them question the very fabric of reality, to make them forget that there’s a method or a gimmick somewhere in plain sight that could explain away the feeling of confusion. To make them not even care about the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words: a gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A magic trick &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a gift. We live in a world of reality almost 24/7, so when I offer you a card trick, I’m offering you a chance to experience the surreal. You can’t just decide to have that. It can’t be contained within a YouTube video. Some event has to naturally occur for you to enter that state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, the surreal occurs without warning. I get to bow tie it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a cousin who will still try to call me out on my tricks. At get togethers, he’ll point out when he notices me slipping on a move. I’ve learned to handle hecklers by not giving them power. And sometimes I’ll even give a quick smile and nod, and continue my trick anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it grinds me a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magic is an art form. It’s somewhere between a game and a performance piece. We play together when I do magic for you. And with any other art form, there’s a suspension of disbelief required for it to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You wouldn’t go to a movie, and in the middle of the most dramatic scene, stand up and proclaim to the audience “this isn’t real! These are actors! You’re crying over &lt;em&gt;fake&lt;/em&gt; events!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or like watching tv shows on particular types of drugs. You start to notice the lighting, the set, the make up. You start to see the show as a recording of actors in a studio. It becomes mundane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live with mundane. It’s necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a moment that is unique and surreal and inexplicable? It’s a gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t ever forget that.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Problems In Education</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2018-01-06-new-problems-in-education/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//localhost:1313/posts/2018-01-06-new-problems-in-education/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine posted an article about 6 problems in education… and I realized that we’ve heard these arguments over and over for the past decade or so, and videos and articles like these keep being made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasn’t anyone paid attention to the work being in done in schools to address these issues? Yes, we’re a long way from progressive being the norm, but here’s my breakdown of the video which is linked &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okpg-lVWLbE&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Hasn’t anyone paid attention to the work being in done in schools to address these issues? Yes, we’re a long way from progressive being the norm, but here’s my breakdown of the video which is linked &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okpg-lVWLbE&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem 1&lt;/strong&gt; – Industrial values, this is still somewhat true (I narrated the audio version of the Seth Godin book about this, which doesn’t give me extra clout or anything, but definitely made me think deeply about the topic as a side effect before I became a teacher), but to me, a lot of schools have moved beyond just compliance within a class, and so many teachers I’ve worked with allow and encourage freedom of expression. Teachers may not allow a free for all, but there is a lot of work being done around voice and choice. The biggest issue that still exists to me is class size. With a class of 25 kids, you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; employ some of those factory management techniques because there are just too many students to serve in a way that is sensible, customized and effective. You want to provide a good educational experience for everyone, and one person can’t tailor an individualized program for every single student. Restructuring how resources are used in the system could help, but that would require more money so unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem 2&lt;/strong&gt; – Lack of autonomy. I could probably just copy and paste what you wrote about because it sums it up so well. Knowing what to prioritize when you have autonomy is a skill in and of itself. I consider myself to be a pretty productive person but when I went freelance-ish this year, I had a hard time structuring my day. The key is balance. Yeah, you don’t wanna send the message that kids aren’t in charge of their own lives, but you also have to provide some structure to the choices they could potentially make and set limits on choices that won’t move a student toward mastery of a skill (however you define that in your classroom, anyway). Autonomy is important but you’re 100% right that many kids would pick the path of least resistance. I believe this to be true because most adults would too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem 3&lt;/strong&gt; – Memorization &amp;amp; rote learning. This is becoming more of an outdated argument. One could certainly argue that the Common Core expects things of students that aren’t developmentally appropriate, but for most states, the emphasis is on mastery of skill and not memorization of facts. I’m sure there are still schools across the country that need to modernize, but I feel like we’re moving in a good direction in this dimension. I’ve also worked in fairly progressive schools so my perspective might be a bit skewed. But to say that kids just memorize useless facts… is not something I’ve experienced in any way at any school in which I’ve taught. It’s what the kids do with those facts that is important, even in schools with less progressive values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem 4&lt;/strong&gt; – No room for passions/interests. This comes down to teachers. I think all kids ask themselves what they’re good at and what they love to do. And without a forward thinking teacher, it’s hard to make this part of your educational life if your passion/interest is not, say, reading or writing. This relates back to the issue of class size. If every teacher in America were given a class of, say, 8 students or so… you’d see some amazing expression and leveraging of assets in every single classroom. It’s just so difficult to do on top of everything else when the class exceeds a certain number of students (and that number isn’t high). I don’t think the system will ever formalize the process of finding one’s spark because that can’t be systemized. It comes down to positive adult/student relationships and creative teaching practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem 5&lt;/strong&gt; – Differences in how we learn. This may be the most outdated argument in the video. Differentiation is mainstream now, isn’t it? Especially with the push for mastery learning, students do get to learn at their own pace. Even on standardized tests, students with disabilities or who are ELLs get accommodations. This is not to say that there isn’t room to grow because there &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; is… but this video seems to make some sweeping claims that undermine a lot of the great work that schools and individual teachers are doing with differentiation. (Not to mention the tech tools)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem 6&lt;/strong&gt; – Lecturing. Okay, maybe THIS is the most outdated. Turn and talks, social complexity structures, inquiry based learning, play based learning, flipped classroom etc… there’s a lot of work being done to transform the classroom experience. It’s hard to say where the country is on this journey, but based on the 3 different schools I’ve worked in (that all operate completely differently), the focus is on what students are saying, doing, creating, etc. Teachers plan with Bloom’s, etc. Even some teacher evals I’ve seen focus on the ratio of teacher talk time to student work time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could be wrong, but I’m not sure whoever made this video is an educator. Here is what I’d say are the biggest problems in schools right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of training around the idea of equity, implicit biases, and messaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of access to technology and lack of training for both faculty and teachers around how to use the technology not as a crutch but as an enhancement to learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positive shifts in pedagogical approach while class size sky rocket and thwart those efforts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teacher disempowerment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay compared to the amount of time &amp;amp; energy spent doing the job, leading to burnout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the problem that is so hard to articulate but around behavior. Positive discipline. How does it look in different situations? Where are the boundaries? And what is the goal (less instances of behavior or better control of emotions or appropriate logical consequences or…?) This contributes so much to burn out but it’s also the most complex issue. No one has the answer so I believe more thinking around it is necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just some thoughts as I spend a year on the outskirts of classroom teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Closest Thing To Immortality</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2018-01-01-the-closest-thing-to-immortality/</link>

&lt;p&gt;Ever since Ray Dalio’s book Principles arrived, many people have been thinking less in terms of &lt;em&gt;goals&lt;/em&gt; and more in terms of &lt;em&gt;principles&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, it’s less about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; we do something and more about &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; we do it. This aligns also with the work of Simon Sinek (Start With the Why).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently thought about my own set of principles. From just a quick brainstorming session in my journal, here are three of mine. I’m giving myself permission to change or add to these later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you make things, it makes things better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A line stolen from Nick Blaemire’s apocalyptic musical &lt;em&gt;Soon&lt;/em&gt;, but one that I think about quite often. I’ve spent much of the past few years being ashamed of what I make and publish (I’m not sure when that change happened). But the truth is, that while there are those who will criticize me and other artists for being vulnerable in public, I learn a lot from what I make. What I make causes chain reactions. A video I published in 2012 and a blog post about leaving my job in 2013 resulted in a viral video sensation that was written up in NPR by Robert Krulwich. A Facebook post about teaching ended up getting quoted in a book about education reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You never know when something is going to hit. Perhaps it’s possible to manufacture heart moving art in a formulaic way, but it’s probably better to make things that speak to you in the hopes that they will speak to others. Even if that group of others is relatively small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, making things is the closest thing to immortality that I can think of. I’ve never been alive at the same time as Nick Drake, but his body of work has had a dramatic effect on my life and my own music. I believe in ghosts but I don’t believe that they’re trapped between two worlds; good art transcends the idea of realms. Influence is still possible even in death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re always wrong; we’re always right; we’re always learning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comes in handy when we encounter new perspectives. It’s okay to stand for something. It’s okay to keep your opinions malleable. It’s okay to think you’re right, and it’s &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; okay to admit when you’ve changed your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s great is that if we go by the assumption that all of this is part of the learning process, we create a space for empathy. We’re learning and adapting and colliding and ideating with and for each other. It’s the way it’s always been and will continue to be and it does little good to demonize people since they, too, are learning, and learning comes with massive and frequent mistakes. This is something I’ve struggled with and have had to really embrace in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nutrition, fitness, and spirituality are the bookends of wellness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we eat and how we move matters. When I talk about spirituality, I don’t necessarily mean religion or even mindfulness. Spirituality, for me, means exploring one’s purpose, understanding what contributions will affect the world in a positive way, and then executing the necessary actions to make it happen. For me, writing and publishing work is an act of spirituality. It’s the glue that gives meaning to the fitness and nutrition aspects of this principle.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Garden Variety Shame</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2017-12-31-garden-variety-shame/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My New Year’s Resolution is to accept my own apology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard this rule recently: don’t speak to yourself internally in a way that you would not speak to a friend or family member externally. More specifically, this means no more calling yourself an idiot in your head. If you wouldn’t call a friend or family an idiot when they make a mistake, don’t do it to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have this horrible habit that’s rooted in insecurity: I am embarrassed many of the things I’ve done and said over the years, and weirdly, sometimes it takes years for this embarrassment to set in. Maybe it’s that I feel I’m not smart enough, or woke enough, or &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; enough. I believe this is the act commonly known as &lt;em&gt;dwelling&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Someone else recently referred to embarrassment that makes you hate yourself as shame. It feels shameful to even admit to being constantly ashamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the dwelling feels good and bad at the same time. The process of dwelling feels a bit hopeful, like you’re going reach the bottom of the ocean at some point to grab some kind of magical pearl and all of a sudden you’ll get over whatever it is you’re dwelling on. But it has never (and will never) work like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps everyone second guesses their interactions. And perhaps those who don’t dwell have learned how to forgive themselves for their inevitable constant fuck ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, shuffling experiences, interactions, and memories around in your head is part of the human experience, one that is common to everyone. It’s normal to feel shame. And maybe an apology to myself or to others &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; warranted, occasionally. But most times, it’s just garden variety shame. It’s constant apologies and no acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My New Years resolution is to accept the apology. There’s enough work to do without shame hanging around my neck 24/7. I’m going to reserve shame for the times where I really need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise it’s meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently saw a relative of mine posting about their child coming in last in some athletic competitions at their school. My relative congratulated her child anyway, and told her that participating, not winning, is the most important part of competing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It made me think about my childhood. Frequently, I came in last in races (of any kind). Not second to last, or somewhere in the back of the pack, but &lt;em&gt;dead last&lt;/em&gt;. And I remember my sister once coming in dead last at a horseback riding competition. (I guess it runs in the family.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It made me think about my childhood. Frequently, I came in last in races (of any kind). Not second to last, or somewhere in the back of the pack, but &lt;em&gt;dead last&lt;/em&gt;. And I remember my sister once coming in dead last at a horseback riding competition. (I guess it runs in the family.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think that I’m bitter about this experience, and truth be told, I certainly was bitter at the time. But I got more out of it than I realized. It shaped who I am as an adult. Contrary to popular consolation, I did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; take away the lesson that participation is all that matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, there’s a beauty to coming in dead last; an insight that is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; bestowed upon those who come in second place, or even second to last place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you start a race, lined up on equal footing with the rest of the competitors, there’s hope in your mind that you might win, or at least might outperform the majority. And then as time as goes on and you drift to the middle, then the middle back, and eventually to the back, you get more and more discouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then you end up &lt;em&gt;dead last&lt;/em&gt;. And the seriousness with which you took yourself at the start of the race, when you still had hope, is completely gone. And in its place is amusement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who have been &lt;em&gt;dead last&lt;/em&gt; are in on a joke that is available only to those who have had the same experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, the race doesn’t matter and never did. Participation is irrelevant. A bunch of people decided to run around and infinite loop and pick an arbitrary measurement to identify success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And suddenly it dawns on those in the very last place: competition is directly related to how one defines success. The winner only wins because some person picked some criteria to define success in the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Competition is an illusion&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And suddenly, to those who are in very last place, the world and all of its opportunities begin to open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It begs the question: &lt;em&gt;Now that you know competition is an illusion, what are you capable of?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2017 A Best Of List In Perspective</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;+++
title = &amp;ldquo;12&amp;rdquo;
date = 2017
+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year since I was in high school, I’ve published some kind of list of my favorite discoveries throughout the year. This year, I’ll talk about my favorites but also how my consumption habits have changed. It’s important, and when my great-great-great grandchildren read this years from now, I want them to understand what was happening in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way that we find art has changed every single year. At one point, most people relied on word of mouth to hear about the art that would suit them best. Then, they looked to magazines and newspapers. Then it was blogs. Then, the social media universe with all of its videos, tweets, and Instagram stories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The way that we find art has changed every single year. At one point, most people relied on word of mouth to hear about the art that would suit them best. Then, they looked to magazines and newspapers. Then it was blogs. Then, the social media universe with all of its videos, tweets, and Instagram stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, we turn to Artificially Intelligent robots that recommend things to us based on our listening and viewing habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s not all. The trust I have in the reliability of my sources has changed as well. It used to be that I’d see a recommendation from a random person online and I’d check out whatever they were writing about. Now, I ignore most of those, and I have a very small groups of friends and family (under 6) and I’ll watch or listen to anything they recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it this way? Other than the fact that there’s just so much more art to choose from, we’ve divided ourselves into tiny micro cultures. It’s why the Best Of Lists this year are more diverse than they’ve ever been before, or at least that’s how it seems to me. Ask me for my favorite genre 10 years ago, and I would’ve said Pop/Rock because that happened to my favorite section in the record store. In 2017, I can be much more specific. The internet has allowed us to curate and find our own path, rather than tread on the one paved by Sam Goody or Tower Records (which was an awesome store).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;music-in-2017-ai-cultivated-playlists&#34;&gt;Music in 2017: AI Cultivated Playlists&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll just have to admit, right off the bat, that we live in a playlist culture. There was a culture of listening to full albums a few years ago but that’s in the past, thanks to online streaming services curating music that robots know we’ll enjoy. I’ve still been into some great records throughout the past year, but it’s the &lt;em&gt;singles&lt;/em&gt; that have left me enlightened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One realization I’ve had is that I don’t really listen to ambient music anymore. I don’t know if it’s the fact that my attention span has shortened due to our fast-paced media culture or if I’ve just outgrown it. It’s the same with punk emo music. I’m leaving the door open for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; type of music to return to my tastes in 2018, but this is what I’ve noticed for now. I also listen to less jazz than I used to, though I still enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few singles, artists, and albums that have changed me this year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Outfield&lt;/em&gt; by The Night Game. Spotify says this is my most played song of the year. This is one of two singles that the band has on Spotify and they toured with John Mayer this year. Martin Johnson, the lead singer of the Night Game, was the frontman for Boys Like Girls, an emo rock band from the 2000s. It kind of sounds like the band The Outfield (which is the name of this song). Or perhaps the police. Gotye sings on the chorus. The chorus, by the way, will stick to you like honey. Their other song on Spotify (Once in a Lifetime) is also great. Johnson’s voice has changed completely and it’s full of beauty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sky Trails&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lighthouse&lt;/em&gt; by David Crosby. Crosby blows my mind. He’s 75 years old and has put out two amazing albums in the last couple of years (2017’s Sky Trails and 2016’s Lighthouse). The song “By the Light of Common Day” goes down as one of the best songs I’ve ever heard, and you’ve got to hear both Crosby’s version (produced by Michael League of Snarky Puppy, who also contributes to the vocals, guitar, and album’s production… as well as Becca Stevens who co-wrote the tune). Stevens and Crosby sing together on the beautiful title track on Sky Trails. The rest of the songs on both releases are just gorgeous and inspired. It’s the type of music to listen to while driving. And you should probably listen to Becca Stevens’ version of By The Light of Common Day, alternatively called The Muse on Becca’s album Venus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;DAMN.&lt;/em&gt; by Kendrick Lamar. I enjoyed every single song on this. I think he goes into the category of Radiohead, in the sense that he never seems to release a bad album. The visual accompaniment that we get from his music videos is also wonderful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tank and the Bangas NPR performance&lt;/em&gt;. This was particularly inspiring because I try to make my live performances have somewhat of an arc. It’s always nice when an audience member tells me they went through a range of emotions in a short period of time. That’s how I feel about the Tank and the Bangas set. It was funny, introspective, sad, and inspiring. To feel that range of emotion in one 15 minute performance is a blessing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Little Fictions&lt;/em&gt; by Elbow. An album for songwriters. It just makes me wonder how Guy Carvey comes up with all of his ideas. How he got this way. And what I can do to catch up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;movies--tv&#34;&gt;Movies &amp;amp; TV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one might imagine, my selections this year come from the vast streaming universe, mostly from Netflix which has managed to create a collection of absolutely stunning shows. I’ve found that I’m less into shows that leave you with well-designed cliffhangers, and more into shows that make you binge due to the great storylines. I imagine this also has to do with the shift from week-by-week television to an entire series available at once. With week-to-week TV, you need the most memorable cliffhanger possible, even if it means sacrificing the story… but no longer. And I’m cool with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s no question that Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;Big Mouth&lt;/em&gt; grabbed me and wouldn’t let me go. It’s kind of a combination of Family Guy, South Park, The Wonder Years, Doug, Modern Family, Full House, and an after school special. The cast is impeccable and my favorite character changes each time I watch the show (it’s currently Missy). The show is about puberty, and it can get a little uncomfortable. My recommendation is watching the first episode’s intro (before the credits). You’ll know if the show is for you. Then, watch the first 3 episodes. You’ll probably watch all of it, and then tell all your friends. Also, there’s a song in almost every episode, and they’re all extremely well constructed. I love this show more than most animated adult-swim like shows because the characters are all totally lovable. Also, Maya Rudolph and Nick Kroll &lt;em&gt;steal the freaking show&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ozark. Jason Bateman showed his prowess both as a serious actor and as a director. And any time Laura Linney is on the screen, it makes me remember that she is one of the best working actresses in Hollywood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I saw Get Out at least 3 times, which is a big deal for me (someone who rarely sees any movies, let alone the same movie 3 times). I watched it with a number of different friends and family and found something new to enjoy every time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stranger Things 2 was worth the wait. My only complaint (spoilers) is that Eleven doesn’t really team up with the rest of the gang. In fact, she hangs with Mike for about 11 seconds. That, and the second to last episode was a departure I could’ve done without.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handmaid’s Tale was scary and brilliant. Scary because it’s so relevant. Brilliant because… well, same reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;American Vandal was an interesting idea that was executed really well. I’ve never seen a mockumentary style show where the characters are not in on the joke at all. One of the most unique shows I’ve seen in a long time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hunt for the Wilderpeople. This didn’t come out in 2017 but it seems to be the year people were turned on to it. I watched it on a plane and was totally taken. It’s a funny but touching story about a kid who runs away from his foster parents and encounters some really interesting situations along the way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wild Tales. Also didn’t come out in 2017, but it’s basically a bunch of short stories about justice and revenge. The opening clip is available online if you look in the right spots. It’s weird, interesting, thought provoking, and hilarious, all at once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;books&#34;&gt;Books&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark Manson’s Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. It will make you think about what truly deserves your mindshare, and what truly doesn’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More Songwriters on Songwriting by Paul Zollo. Reading pages and pages about creative process is hit or miss, but when you have a lineup of the best songwriters in the world, it becomes more than palatable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Defense of Food by Michael Pollan. Not from 2017, but this is the year I read it and digested it. Eat food, not too much, mostly plants. It’s a framework I’ve learned to live by and it’s made a gigantic difference to my health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While I haven’t gotten through all of it, Tim Ferriss’ new book, Tribe of Mentors is an interesting concept – the same well crafted eleven questions get asked to some of the world’s top performers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;podcasts&#34;&gt;Podcasts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The James Altucher Show – specifically, the episodes where interviews Tiffany Haddish and Stephen Tobolowsky (Ned Ryerson from Groundhog Day). Tobolowsky has an amazing way of telling stories and expelling wisdom. I felt smarter and more in touch with myself afterward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I listen to Back to Work with Merlin Mann and Dan Benjamin every week. It’s not for everyone, but I’ve been following Mann for over a decade and he has given me some amazing ideas that have become staples in my life (movies, tv shows, and productivity systems/tools).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pod Save America is also a show I listen to whenever there’s a new episode. In a world that gets increasingly more scary and depressing, this podcast really does save me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sodajerker on Songwriting. There’s something about these interviewers that brings out the most amazing responses from songwriters. It gets really geeky, which is pleasing to a music nerd like me. Best episodes I heard were from Adam Duritz (Counting Crows), Glen Ballard, and Me’shell Ndgeocelo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also really enjoyed Cortex with CGP Grey and Myke Hurley. I especially enjoyed their most recent episode, State of the Apps, where they break down their most used iOS and Mac apps. It got me into Ulysses, which is a great app for writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twenty Thousand Hertz. A brilliant concept: a podcast about all the random sounds in the world. I listened to their episode on the sounds of an airplane, and how the sounds may contribute to a fear of flying. They recommended noise cancelling headphones to deal with flying anxiety, and the cans I got changed my life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;apps--purchases&#34;&gt;Apps &amp;amp; Purchases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got a Microsoft Foldable Keyboard. It fits in my pocket and expands into a full bluetooth keyboard so I can write and do more intensive work on the go directly from my phone. Kind of life changing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My Sony MDR1000x, which are the most amazing noise-cancelling headphones. When I wear these on a plane, it blocks out &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; if not &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the jet engine noise, so I can just chill and listen to music or podcasts. They’re not cheap (around $300) but they have made flying a million times more enjoyable for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even though I technically paid for it 4 years ago, I still get a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of mileage out of Omnifocus. I actually switched to Todoist for a month because I needed something cross-platform and ended up returning to Omnifocus. It’s not for everyone, but if you understand how GTD works and you have a busy life with a lot of tasks, this will set you straight and help you get work done and meet deadlines. The Lamborghini of task managers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marpac Sound Generator Dome. This basically has a very loud fan inside of it that produces white noise and the volume is adjusted by changing the amount of air that passes through the holes in the dome. I live in a really noisy part of town, and this helps me get to sleep when the clubs outside are pumping their jams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paprika Recipe Manager. If you enjoy cooking and using recipes, you need this. You can grab recipes off the web and it’ll parse them and string out the ingredients and directions. You can then scale the ingredient quantities based on the amount of servings needed, and create a grocery list automatically organized by aisle. Now if only grocery stores would keep everything in the designated aisles. It took me forever to find feta cheese the other day because it was in the deli, not the cheese aisle. There’s a Mac and iOS app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;resolutions&#34;&gt;Resolutions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My resolutions for next year are to finish more books (whether that’s on audible or on the kindle or in print), and to listen to more full albums. I bet there’s a lot of great stuff that I missed. I definitely did not skimp on the podcasts though. I also feel like I need to watch less TV and see more movies. I still haven’t seen the ones that people are calling the best of the year. But it will happen. I also want to listen to more instrumental music.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Eliciting Wonder</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to find someone who doesn’t enjoy some kind of music. Same goes for movies, and even fine art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But poetry? When it comes to poetry, there are vast amounts of haters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about Shel Silverstein. People love him for his simplicity. The words rhyme so your brain can almost fill in the blanks. I think the lack of work required to get enjoyment out of his poems is relatively small.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Think about Shel Silverstein. People love him for his simplicity. The words rhyme so your brain can almost fill in the blanks. I think the lack of work required to get enjoyment out of his poems is relatively small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s that poetry is a form of word art, as opposed to a novel that is perhaps a form of sentence art. Stringing sentences together to tell a compelling story is challenging. Take away the structure of sentences, though, and ask the reader to interpret their own meaning, and it seems that you’ve asked too much. It’s like eating finger food vs. a 3 course meal with a beginning, middle, and end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then again, the finger food was never meant to satiate. It was meant to elicit wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it goes with poetry as well. The day that a person reads a poem that elicits wonder is the day that a person begins to love poetry. If a poem produces hunger of the spirit, then the poet &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; their reader has won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t understand every single line of T.S. Elliot’s Prufrock. But I do know that “I have measured out my life in coffee spoons” hits me in a way that no TV show ever could.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Choose To Get It Or Be Moved Anyway</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Liza and I went to an art museum last weekend (the Renwick in DC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what I’d experienced in the past at art museums that made me feel this way, but whatever it was was weighing down on my excitement level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing we saw when we walked in was a gigantic chandelier that looked almost like it was glimmering. The different pieces of glass that composed the giant chandelier had been programmed to light up/down in such a way that the same patterns were never repeated. It’s the kind of thing you can’t pick up from watching it (unless you have &lt;em&gt;infinite time&lt;/em&gt;), but just the knowledge that this thing had its own endless pattern was interesting enough. I guess it helps to read the plaques.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I guess it helps to read the plaques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a train display, too. A big wooden box with peepholes and a miniature train station inside, like looking at an empty, abandoned microscopic world. And as you walked around the wooden box, there was a life-sized train environment too. With tunnels on either end that looked that they went on forever (although they didn’t, since the box fit inside of the room).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Forced perspective,” the attendant told me. “Visual perception gets manipulated because you can’t actually go inside the tunnels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind of like the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disney – an endless night sky somehow, because you can’t leave the boat to climb up and check if it’s real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my friends once told me, a long time ago, that knowing an artist’s motives didn’t enhance the experience for him. In the case of these two exhibits, it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last thing I saw before I left was a McDonald’s bag that had been sliced up in the middle. The bag was lying on its side. If you looked at the bag from the top, it looked like the middle had been eaten by bugs; but if you knelt down and looked inside the bag, there was a beautiful diorama of a tree. &lt;em&gt;How many bags of fast food have I tossed without a second thought about the possibilities of rearranging the molecules?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a book In the book store that explained how to enjoy art. The rules seemed simple enough: if you’re moved by it, no one can take away your experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even those pieces of art that are just a seemingly blank canvas still cause conversation, and so they’re important. Even if it causes anger, disgust, scorn, and hatred… an emotional reaction took place. You felt something you otherwise wouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s like seeing something against the backdrop of your experiences and your own life stories. You can &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; to get it, in the same way I chose to listen to My Bloody Valentine’s Loveless 45 times to uncover the magic lying underneath all those walls of guitar sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even if you don’t choose to get it, art can still move you. That movie you walked out of, that graffiti you scoffed at, the way that accountant wore socks with sandals… maybe you didn’t choose to get it, but it moved you. And that’s powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Godly, even.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Most Beautiful Moment In Matilda</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2017-12-11-the-most-beautiful-moment-in-matilda/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s at the very start of the book. Matilda discovers her local library, and starts to read everything on the shelves. She finishes all the kids books, and then moves on to the adult books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, the librarian informs her that public libraries allow one to take books home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her reaction: could &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, after books were basically banned from her household. This, after she had to find refuge from her terrible parents at a local library. This. Portable literacy. Like when I got a walkman after years of being chained to a plugged in record player (I spun &lt;em&gt;Bad&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;True Blue&lt;/em&gt; if you must know).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Her reaction: could &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, after books were basically banned from her household. This, after she had to find refuge from her terrible parents at a local library. This. Portable literacy. Like when I got a walkman after years of being chained to a plugged in record player (I spun &lt;em&gt;Bad&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;True Blue&lt;/em&gt; if you must know).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roald Dahl doesn’t describe Matilda’s face during this scene. But if he did, I imagine it would qualify for the most awesome visual in the book.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Recording Of A Lawnmower</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have this recurring conversation with a friend of mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We argue about whether or not a particular musician is “good.” And often it becomes a battle of who has the strongest opinion, or the most confident tone, or the highest credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation starts to unravel the way of a ball of yarn does; slowly but surely transforming a surface area sweater into a relentless puffy string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It becomes about the notes, about the technical aspects of the playing, about the cred. The magic of the music becomes reduced to a simple explanation involving harmony, or key changes, or some &lt;em&gt;je ne sais quoi&lt;/em&gt; that is both important and unimportant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;“The only way I can judge music,” I say as slowly as one can say something while an idea is still forming, “is by how it makes me feel. In the same way that I evaluate the morning commute: I don’t know shit about traffic patterns and complexity; I just know I’m traumatized for a good 30 seconds after arrival.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pause. I say this next part with the highest degree of sincerity I can muster for 11pm on a Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You could play me a recording of a lawnmower and if it moves me to tears, I will replay it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A lawnmower?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. Too often, I find myself judging sound against what I’m used to, rather than appreciating the inherently unique quality of the thing. I smile at my friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve heard some lawnmowers that were more dramatic than opera.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently watched this documentary called Andy &amp;amp; Jim about how Jim Carey basically assumed, full-time, the spirit/zeitgeist of Andy Kaufman/Bob Clifton in the outstanding movie &lt;em&gt;Man on the Moon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But doing so required that I first re-watch &lt;em&gt;Man on the Moon&lt;/em&gt;, which I hadn’t seen since it came out in 18 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both movies, interestingly, are centered around creative struggle, expression, innovation, and the undeniable connection between sadness and humor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;5 thoughts from the movie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Truly innovative art spurs haters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Truly innovative art touches souls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reggie Watt’s Twitter bio, for the longest time, has said “In the absence of truth there is confusion; the essence of truth.” The essence of something is more magical, more spiritual, than a direct connection to that something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being firm in your convictions means a lot of people will misunderstand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Psychological Halloweenism (assuming someone else’s persona) can be addictive.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>My Life On Ten Floppies</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve always had this weird obsession with robots and artificial intelligence. I would scour the internet looking for new apps that could respond to what I’m saying with some shred of intelligence and I would try to write programs that would seem intelligent. The biggest thrill of my life came from a program I wrote (in Basic) that would ask you for your name, and then spit it back to you in the form of some salutation. It wasn’t artificially intelligent, but it was a huge success with my other geek-friends, who I gave copies to on a 3.5 floppy.&lt;br&gt;
Eight years later, I’m still a technology geek, but I’m not amazed by the little improvements anymore. A search I run in Google will be analyzed and I will be offered relevant marketing messages, Gmail knows who I frequently write mail to, and the internet tailors itself to my needs and preferences. It’s too bad that my little 3kb program won’t even run anymore on a platform beyond Win98 without the user having to manually open a command line.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been having this feeling lately: I’ve forgotten something. That state where you can’t remember what you’re supposed to be remembering. Maybe it’s because I’ve been doing a better job of capturing everything lately, and it almost seems like a trap. Or I really am forgetting something or someone.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The weather is dependable.  I’m always amazed by the punctuality of the seasons.  I haven’t been able to devote my attention to one solid thing for the past few months, and I’m learning to appreciate it.  This may be the last time my life can be divided into 4 easy and distinct elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinner tonight: sushi.  Aleena’s recommendation.  Kentlands has these interesting restaurants popping up – a crepe place, of all things.  I had the spider sushi, which sounds like it would be painful.  It’s just crabmeat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Surprised mom by asking her if I could rake the leaves.  It’s not like mowing – there’s the same amount of noise, but less of it is machine-made.  It became clear to me today that I’m very suburban oriented.  I get restless if I don’t drive a car for a few weeks.  Mindless errands: Target has everything.  I ended up buying a blue/green light bulb for my bathroom at school.  I’ll probably get tired of it after a while, but it will be interesting in the morning when I wake up with 15 minutes to get to work, dash into the bathroom to take a shower, and have a wave of aqua colored light wash over me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve linked my blog to my facebook notes.  It’s no big deal, really.  Writing, regardless of the content, is always a nice way for me to sort things out.  Sitting around and strumming the guitar has never done it for me, other than get some tension worked out of the hands (and face).  Speaking of which, I’ve got a new recording in the works.  Zach and I sat down and worked out a bold arrangement of a song that I wrote.  In 60 tracks or so, we had something workable.  I’m still playing around with the mix (huge and hairy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fall break: just cold enough, Starbucks, Chipotle.  I’ve generally spent most of my fall breaks alone, especially with Aleena at school now.  This time, lots of people are home, including Aleena.  Midterm Monday, and it’s looking like a hard one.  Means that fall break isn’t really a break, but a change of environment, at least for a few days.  Maybe that’s all I need.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I develop a similar habit wherever I work: get to work, do a few tasks, go get a mid-morning snack, do more work, late lunch, relax, and go home. Billy and Andy came over the other night to work on some songs. We molded a song that Andy had written a year ago – Time Has Passed, or something like that. Changed the chord structure a little bit (it’s always easier playing a guitar rather than a piano) and worked the melody so that Billy could add in some harmonies. One of the previous nights, we had a long discussion about music over a few whisky sours. Billy and Andy understand music theory well enough to discuss it and emote over the same complexities, and while I know some basics, I’m much more into sound rather than notes. Admittedely, as Billy pointed out, my brain works with music differently than Andy and different than himself. It’s possible that we, as a planet, work differently with music, but surprisingly, we have similar emotions over some music. At the same time, we have very polar emotions over some other types of songs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It’s possible that we, as a planet, work differently with music, but surprisingly, we have similar emotions over some music. At the same time, we have very polar emotions over some other types of songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t really point it out. Is it the tone of the voice, the chord progression, the melody of an instrument layered over the progression, the acoustics in the room of the recording, the processing? Which is the thing that pushes the music over the edge of emotion, and why does that edge exist in different places for different people? And is that thing different for same music and different people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We began recording the song. I recorded the guitar part with some effect, and Andy felt nervous about singing because it was late in the dorms. Even though we were pretty certain no one could hear from my bedroom with the door closed, Andy has a very loud voice. We took a break to smoke and eat Chinese food. Talked with a public safety officer about getting a ticket and things to do to avoid getting charged. If a cop asks you why you think he pulled you over, say you don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening to Sandi Thom’s record Smile… it confuses people. Interesting arrangements and production. The single, “I wish I was a Punk Rocker” is a very catchy radio song that may have been recorded with fancy production and a big band sound, but was eventually stripped down to nothing but a melody line, harmonies, and percussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Went home last night to watch Tsotsi with my dad and my sister. It’s one of those movies that builds and builds until a really dramatic final scene involving lots of eye contact, long pauses, hesitation, and suspense. Sometimes I wish I was a film maker. I would want too much control, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using a program called Melodyne, which can take a melody line and let you edit the individual notes. You can sculpt the pitch to however you want it, you can create harmonies, or an entire choir if you felt like it. This may open up a lot of doors. Also inherited a Les Paul guitar from Scott, who acquired it from his friend in Japan. Playing electric guitar feels so unnatural to me, although it shouldn’t, since it’s almost the same as playing a synth. Except instead of data, there are actual sound waves involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans for tonight: hang out with Scott and get dinner. Maybe see what Andy’s up to, if his wisdom teeth haven’t kept him pinned down. I don’t know where home base is right now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve finally moved into my new home in Letts Hall. It’s funny to think that I used to live on Northside and work on Southside and now it’s the exact opposite. Once I stopped working at Weichert, there wasn’t a specific time of day that I could write in this log, so I stopped unintentionally. Once I find that time in my new job, I can update daily once again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Once I find that time in my new job, I can update daily once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been seeing lots of free movies lately, courtesy of Aimee’s job at an advertising agency. Miami Vice was one of the better ones, but I wouldn’t recommend it to someone looking for a good plot. Interested in seeing Little Miss Sunshine, because I want to see Carrell doing something different. I’ve been reading quite a bit as well. DeBono’s Thinking Hats is very well thought out, but just like any other new way of thinking, it will be rejected countlessly by organization leaders who have “always done it this way.” As for new music, I’ve been listening to the Silversun Pickups (excellent guitar tones, great writing) and now a band called Maritime. Still sit on my couch and listen to Eno on Vinyl. I almost have all of his rock albums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, the apartment is one of the most exciting places I’ve ever been in. Nevermind the fact that I can live for free in a fantastic room with a queen size bed, the shower is one of the most refreshing things I’ve ever used. The new job has been stressful, but eventful, mainly because of the amounts of red tape I’ve had to trip over to get things to happen. It’s always disappointing when someone comes up with a new method which will conserve worker’s time and energy for more important tasks, and the organization sets up twenty hoops for him to jump through. It’s also frustrating to spend energy on a project and not know whether or not the product will actually be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RA Training begins in a week and Paul comes back as soon as it’s over. Then, welcome week begins.  Mike left for Texas, and we had a nice goodbye party to send him on his way. Old Ebbit’s Grill – I ordered the mussels. They were good, but I wish I had gone with the seafood salad. When mealplans don’t exist, I try to be as extravagant as possible with my dining decisions. Ed and Scott are moving into a new apartment which looks promising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans for today: maybe recording with Andy, getting school-ish supplies, Joe’s Record Paradise for entertainment music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notebook I bought fits in my pocket, barely, and I bought a few pens to go with it.  I linked to an article yesterday which explains how to buy a Mont Blanc ink cartridge and install it into a 2 dollar pen.  Basically, you’re getting the ink of a 300 dollar pen into your tiny little G2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;random images, like “four corners”, “dark panel”, “skylight frames the night sky”, “sending smoke signals bouncing off of trees.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a chart of blind adjective-noun pairings (I’ll explain later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an algorithm involving time intervals between frog noises in Andy’s backyard, which I can loop infinitely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;descriptions of sound: cavernous, bubbly, tire-gravel, croak, chirp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a sonic sketch of Andy’s deck: what a blind person would experience.  X marks the “viewer” and lines connect the viewer to the sound descriptions with lines.  non-encapsulating barrier of brick and glass behind us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ideas like going to a movie by yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at Office Depot, I also grabbed about 500 blank index cards, and created a deck of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rtqe.net/ObliqueStrategies/&#34;&gt;Oblique Strategies&lt;/a&gt;.  Since they’re all available on that website, I decided to make a DIY deck.  The actual one costs about 60 dollars.  It’s good that I saved some money since I’ve bought all these records.  Speaking of which Music For Airports, Music For Films, and Another Green World have been shipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Went to Guitar Center to get Andy a converter for his keyboard into Reason, but it turns out that it didn’t work.  It’s too bad, I would’ve been interested to see what he came up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ate at Noodle Company right before it closed.  Penne Rosa for Andy, Japanese Pan for me.  Then, an episode of Entourage and back to Andy’s where we played the noun-adjective game, that was actually created by Grant and I.  One person thinks of a noun, and the other an adjective.  The idea is that these two words collide from completely unassuming and unknowing thought banks.  A natural way to write lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home early to watch Alias and discuss the spiritual-scientific spectrum with Kevin online. Still have had no time to write music for The Wranglers, but I came up with an idea that could get the ball rolling:  recording vocal lines of nonsense words and harmonizing with them, until I get the asthetic quality I want, and add lyrics later.  If I can do about 5-6 songs this way over the weekend, we could end up with a decent sized set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans for tonight:  dinner with Aimee, see what Billy’s up to, try and construct the 300 dollar pen.  I really get nervous about keeping pens in my pocket.  Ink spills are impossible to reverse.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Steady Flow Of Thought</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2006-07-12-a-steady-flow-of-thought/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Idea: Keep another journal handy at all times, with a super strong &lt;a href=&#34;http://lifehacker.com/software/diy/convert-a-3-pen-into-a-200-pen-186819.php&#34;&gt;pen&lt;/a&gt;. Use this to document everything. Take notes on human life, certain light beams, sounds you hear. Use it for exercises like writing five words down. Systematic poetry, non-systematic. Books you’d like to buy, places you’d like to travel. This is different from a blog – you collect thoughts, rather than compose them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy’s new deck is nice. Before that, went to Potbelly with Billy and Alex, and after that to Barnes and Noble. I bought Six Thinking Hats by Edward De Bono, which I’ve been wanting to read for a while. It’s the idea of having a team that, instead of having a bunch of different perspectives talking at each other all at once, separating the discussion into sections where different persepectives are evaluated at the same time. Everybody can be on the same page, so on and so forth. Useful for next year, I’d imagine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;DC last night with Aimee and Scott to see a sneak preview of You, Me, and Dupree. I like Owen Wilson’s character in this movie, but beyond that, I can safely say that I’m glad not to have paid money for this one. Georgetown Cafe after. Aimee got the burger, Scott the Steak and Cheese, and I got the Gyro Platter. Home after where I spoke to Liza on the phone and watched Alias. Somehow, I can never get into bed before 2 these days, but I’m getting used to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lost the auction for the Eno boxed set. It got pushed up to $103, so I gave in. Instead, I bought some LPs separately: Before and After Science, Here Come the Warm Jets, Music for Airports, Music for Films, and Music For Films III (a bunch of artists contributing including Harold Budd), and Another Green World. I think these are all the Eno albums I’d ever need or want on Vinyl. Maybe Taking Tiger Mountain, at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think half of the reason I buy these things is for the enlarged cover art. I wish there was a way to display albums on my wall in my apartment next year. Maybe there is, and no one has thought of it yet. Work today was fast: I didn’t have a lot of work, but there were more people online than usual, and much more to think about. Great conversation last night before I fell asleep about happiness. Scott said in the car that loneliness should be eliminated from the human repertoire. It’s manufactured, I think he’s on to something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans for tonight: buy a small notebook, a nice pen. Possibly guitar center with Andy to get a cable. Write music. Itching to do that. I got the mix back from my session with the cousins, which is now being referred to as The Family Radio Project. The reverb Sameer bhai put on my vocals is something I’ve been trying to do for a while, and he says that he used a default setting. We stumble upon things easily after we finish chasing them, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unlikely Collaboration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once again, PJ returned home without any prior notice.  We went to Joe’s Crab Shack to say hi to Billy, who is now working as a barback.  He was sweaty when we met up with him.  PJ created a mission of throwing any excess food into the center of the paper towel roll in the table.  Being children again is satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My rental from blockbuster is overdue.  For some reason, I can’t seem to drive the extra mile and a half to return library books or video rentals.  It’s almost as if I feel too good for them or something.  This explains my love for Blockbuster Online.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;After lobster pasta, Aimee came over, and PJ left.  After a while of trying to decide a course of action, we went to Joe’s Crab Shack, which turns into a night club after 11pm, apparently.  I suddenly got very sick, and Aimee left after finishing half of a Corona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while I thought the workday had slowed down significantly, but today is proof that I’m fast forwarding with ease.  Maybe it was more things to occupy my mind today.  I finally got an assignment from &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;esquel&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;, a foundation that has hired me to maintain their website.  If you take a look, you’ll see that it’s pretty barebones.  I created a new design, but I have yet to implement it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday night had a smoke with Billy and my sister.  Enjoyable.  It’s funny that I get worried about her developing some sort of disease from smoking hookah too much.  I’m looking forward to having clean lungs for a while starting next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night caught up with Andy and watched a few more episodes of entourage.  Afterwards, we recorded a &lt;a href=&#34;http://nw01.american.edu/finalmix.mp3&#34;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; which involves Andy’s narrative voice and my synth playing.  It’s short but provocative, and we didn’t come up with the words ourself.  They were taken from Astonish Yourself, some arbitrary chapter, but I like the way that the author puts his words together.  I think this particular chapter was on cleaning a room.  It consists of 3 tracks: 1) me playing the synth with a spacey sort of patch, 2) Andy narrating bits and pieces of a chapter of this book, so as not to be too specific, the listener can apply the advice to anything.  My music trails on for a bit after he finishes speaking.  3) Another track of Andy’s narration, copied and pasted, except this time I’ve applied a tape loop.  It sounds almost like cicadas in the background, but it’s actually Andy’s voice in a huge feedback loop.  Eventually the cicadas fade and Andy wraps up his advice to the listener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve decided that we want to make more creations like this, with the objective in mind before we begin.  It’s something I really want to get into with Ryan.  One idea we’ve been playing around with is recording ambient noise from my deck, the frogs croaking, the fireflies lighting up (no sound, but there is some presence) and using some sort of method to create songs.  I’m really into the idea of unlikely collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made it my goal to collect all four of Brian Eno’s Ambient LPs.  I bought 2-4 from Joe’s Record Paradise, but it’s apparently very hard to locate Music For Airports.  I can’t even locate it on ebay, aside from a boxed set of about 10 Eno LPs.  The initial price was 30 dollars, so I bid on it, and I found someone wanted it more than I.  So I kept bidding to see how high this guy had bid.  At this point, I’m almost hoping that I lose the action.  Which seems reasonable, this guy made a very high bid.  But then again, these are truly collector’s items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today as I was creating a binder, I suddenly came up with lyrics.  How does inspiration hit so fast and at the wrong time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans for tonight:  see Billy, possibly Andy.  Maybe create music with them.  Back to AU in a week.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Create A Museum</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Idea: collect artifacts from your lifetime and make a museum. You can make your life an exhibit, and the rest of your family can do the same, creating a museum of family culture. A living, breathing, interactive space for people to learn about your history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mine would have: strollers, shoes, my fisher-price phonograph, my trampoline, my bunk bed, the radial nerve splint, some clothes that were staples, Mr. Peanut, blue bear, that Orbitz drink, my old boombox. Each would have a tag describing what nook that particular item fit into, why it was important.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This weekend was long and nice. Caleb was in town, and we tried to go mini golfing, but it was closed. Some policy of closing the gates an hour before the actual closing time. We played party games on both nights, which was exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott, Mike, and I finally rehearsed which was a lot of fun. Moonlight sounds like new guitar parts, and Two Birds sounds like tight three part harmony. It’s fun watching them work. My mind works differently I guess – I can’t put together harmonies as easily and methodically as they can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth of July was 20 mins driving a few miles away from my house, a half an hour of waiting for the fireworks, ten minutes of actual fireworks, and 45 mins of trying to exit the parking lot. Then Hard Times where we met Billy and Alex for drinks, and saw a few wootton Alum there. Mike, of all people. I got his cell number and we had a brief conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smoked hookah with Bill, Alex, and Andy. Andy was getting annoyed with some of the random comments Billy made, and I was reminded of a lot of Zen theory. Something out of nothing will always return to nothing – a harmless joke or completely irrelevant comment will douse the flame. I had forgotten about that. When I talk with Andy, we try very hard to rationalize everything, and that isn’t the way I normally operate. Trying something new for once, but I think that if my mind was occupied with other thoughts, I wouldn’t be able to handle it. Almost as if I have a capacity for too much analysis. Reminds of Jig-saw: you already know what the picture will look like because you can see it on the cover, but you feel some sense of accomplishment for figuring out where the pieces go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been drinking tea at work. There’s a different flavor for every day that I have left at the office. Speaking of which, Rosie called yesterday to tell me that I may be able to come back a week early. It doesn’t mean summer has been cut even shorter. Summer won’t actually be over for me until Welcome Week, mentally. Either way, it’ll feel good to be walking around during the day instead of wasting my brain away at this chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy and I watched Matchpoint last night and a little bit of Entourage, which reminds me of Swingers. That whole voyeuristic male bonding thing. It was alright, and I think if it doesn’t really entertain me within the next few episodes, I will probably stop watching. Matchpoint blew me away once again. This morning, listened to one of Ryan’s records. His songs are almost like collections of subsongs. It’s enthusiastic and full of enegy, like Ryan is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to play golf some time. I don’t know why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans for tonight: play around with Rewiring Garageband to Reason some more. Watch Wedding Crashers, maybe. And if it’s a nice evening, I think I’ll sit on the deck and drink some nice cider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experiment: Sonic Meditation.  Take a walk by yourself, preferably somewhere with minimal noise.  Picture an aural spectrum around you, colored.  Listen to every pin drop and place it instantaneously in the sonic halo you’ve created for yourself.  I didn’t realize how alive I was until I tried this.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stormy Skies Family Ties Week Flies</title>

&lt;p&gt;The rain finally let up yesterday morning, and I drove to work happily, without the fear of someone skidding into me. Read an interesting Eno story the other day which I’d never heard before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;In January this year I had an accident. I was not seriously hurt, but I was confined to bed in a stiff and static position. My friend Judy Nylon visited me and brought me a record of 18th century harp music. After she had gone, and with some considerable difficulty, I put on the record. Having laid down, I realized that the amplifier was set at an extremely low level, and that one channel of the stereo had failed completely. Since I hadn’t the energy to get up and improve matters, the record played on almost inaudibly. This presented what was for me a new way of hearing music – as part of the ambience of the environment just as the colour of the light and the sound of the rain were parts of that ambience. It is for this reason that I suggest listening to the piece at comparatively low levels, even to the extent that it frequently falls below the threshold of audibility.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally listened to that record by the way – it starts off with a typical Eno idea of two different melodies weaving around each other and mutating for about 30 minutes, and then goes onto to 3 different pieces, in which he’s used Pacabel’s Cannon in different ways. One of them, I’m pretty certain, is the piece played backwards, but you can’t tell unless you listen very carefully. The other one is the actual piece, with the same recording being played over it, in a similar fashion as the title track. The third one – no idea. This was the platform that he sprung off of to create the rest of the ambient series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I get so involved with ambient music over the summer because at work, I don’t like to listen to very loud music. I can’t concentrate on jazz, I can’t concentrate on rock, classical would do but I don’t have a huge selection of stuff that I like (I’m picky about what classical I listen to), so that leaves the ambient/minimalist genre. Perfect because I can leave it as background music and then listen to piece of it if I want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday was a surprise dinner for Dilshad Phuppi, and it was executed well. The food was excellent – shrimp, chicken, beef, rice, with a nice cakey dessert. Watched 24 that night with Aleena. Getting closer to the finale of Season 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, Zain came over and we went to Tara Thai for dinner. I got the pattaya noodles and a tropical treasure. After that, we came home and played Bubble Bobble and I made Zain a 2-disc mix. He told me about a couple of records I should download, the new Advantage record is great. They cover music from 8-bit nintendo games and they have some great tunes on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, DC for a sneak preview of Pirates of the Carribean 2. I was a little underwhelmed, as I’ve been for the past few movies I’ve seen. Aimee, Sarah, Ed, Scott, and Beth were there. Had a horrible time getting out as my sister had the car, and my mom wouldn’t take me to the metro. Coming back to my house, the person who was taking my parking stub wouldn’t let me pay with credit card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got home and fell asleep to Side II of the Koln Concert. That may be my favorite thing on a piano anyone has ever done. I finally have the night to myself for once, so I think I’m going to go get a few things. Some LPs from Joe’s Record Paradise, the I-Connect pillow for my sister, and possibly Guitar Center for some browsing. I really want to buy and learn how to play the sitar, but they’re rather expensive. I think that may one of my goals in life.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Do What You Were Doing 18 Years Ago</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;18 years ago, I was most likely jumping on my trapoline in the basement, an activity which I performed until I got tired. Then, I would take my Fisher-Price phonograph and pull out a random LP from my dad’s collection, and it was generally one that I hadn’t heard before, or didn’t even like, but if the cover was appealing, I would always give it another shot. That was how we bought LPs, dad and I. He would put me on his shoulders and I would select an album based on the artwork. Much easier to do with LPs because of their size – my 2 year old eyes could see everything so vividly. In fact, when we transitioned into CDs, I was horribly upset at the size of the CDs that I didn’t want any despite the fact that our only phonograph was a $20 Fisher-Price and my dad had invested a few thousand dollars in a soundsystem with a cd player.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I returned the digital voice recorder to Best Buy. It was helpful, but I knew I didn’t really need it. Besides, with the store credit I got, I ended up getting a combo &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;phonograph/cd-player/fm-am radio&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;. It’s not that exact model, but it’s similar, and actually a little better looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday, Scott and I worked on the two songs I wrote and he gave good feedback and started coming up with harmonies. I’m lucky that this project is with two people who’ve penned countless a capella arrangements in mathematical code. But music is math, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burger King and then to Scott’s apartment where I gave him an Eno class with audio examples. I figure this is all I do in the summer. Home around 2am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday, went to DC for a Colman-Davis dinner. Scott made rice, which was delicious, and Ed made some exquisite lamb, which we topped off with Cherry 7-up. Dessert was some kind of berry pastry that Ed &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;purchased at the supermarket (Entemann’s)&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; made from scratch. Aimee spent the night at my house since her roommate’s boyfriend was in town, and we went to sleep almost immediately. I woke up the next morning at 9, and I’m not sure why. We ended up going to eat lunch at Star Diner (gig opportunity). I had the gyro platter, Aimee a chicken wrap. I had forgotten how good Star Diner fries are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Went to Barnes and Noble for a bit, where I looked at some books on creativity and social invention. Aimee bought a couple books and headed back to AU. I went to a Milad, which is sort of like a housewarming party with the Muslim equivalent of sermons and hymns. Most of it was in urdu (wish I had learned when I was younger) but I enjoyed the asthetics of the sounds around me. There’s an interesting quality about a group of religious people singing slightly out of tune, because it’s less about the tune, and more about the expression. Got to see Dadi, who was happy that I had come to something religious, and Juni Phuppi, who was sad that I couldn’t make it to King’s Dominion with her and the boys. I told Rian that despite my apparent dedication to my job, between Weichert and King’s Dominion, I’d much rather be at King’s Dominion. Talked to Zain briefly, dinner on Tuesday with him and family. Why is that everyone who comes home does so spontaneously and for a very short period of time? Is this what happens when you get older, or is home become less appealing? Living in DC, I haven’t experienced this yet.&lt;br&gt;
Short dinner afterwards and then home, where I met Andy. Hookah in my garage watching the rain, and then we watched Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control; both of us were sort of overwhelmed. It was one of those movies where are four separate threads that seem as if they will be weaved together by the end, but then no real connection occur between any of the stories. Fell asleep very quickly afterward. Exhausted. It’s been raining a lot. There are a lot of rain poems that use the metaphor of God crying. This is a temper tantrum. What did we do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans for tonight: clean/re-organize room. Put away all CDs, and make space for everything. Set up my MIDI keyboard and audio interface on my desk. Make floor spotless and find a way to not let the room get messy again. Surprise birthday party with family at 7:30. I always have a craving for chinese food. Maybe later I will try building a synth.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had to put together about 3 binders today.  The rest of the day I&amp;rsquo;ve sat around listening to music and reading about synthesizers.  I did find a cool website called longnow.org which has lectures about forward thinking.  Stewart Brand created this orgnization who found it interesting that different people of different cultures envisioned the concept of &amp;ldquo;now&amp;rdquo; very differently.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you asked someone what they were working on &amp;ldquo;now,&amp;rdquo; would they refer to what they&amp;rsquo;ve been doing that hour?  That morning?  That year?  The Long Now organization has decided to make &amp;ldquo;now&amp;rdquo; encompass the next 10,000 years.  They&amp;rsquo;ve even made a clock that plays bells.  They have all of their lectures on the site, and I was listening to the kick-off speech from Eno.  He began by talking about his first ambient record (discreet music, which I still haven&amp;rsquo;t heard), and then went onto the other ambient ones and explained why they relate to time and &amp;ldquo;now.&amp;rdquo;  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Last night, Mariam and Billy came over to watch Prison Break.  I love re-watching that show unfold.  PJ called and said he was home, so him and Andy joined later.  I should&amp;rsquo;ve napped but I spent the entire afternoon playing with my new gear.  Made a quick demo of 2 birds, just to see how it sounded when I was fully listening, and also did a verse and chorus of Bows and Arrows in Garage Band.  That one actually came out sounding nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I saw an amazing video of an Indian guy who created a synth out of  a really cool usb device with a bunch of colored balls.  He throws the balls around and where they hit the wall is where they change velocity and shape.  I want to learn to make music with forces that I can&amp;rsquo;t control, like throwing a ball: it lands in a different place everytime, you did the initial work, and physics took care of the rest.  Drawing on a higher power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Prison Break, we went to Andy&amp;rsquo;s to watch the storm.  Big streaks of lightning, so big that they lit up the entire sky.  We couldn&amp;rsquo;t do the lightning-thunder calculation because there was too much lightning, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out what corresponded to what.  We sat on his deck, sheilded by the short ceiling, smoking fruit, and watching the lightning.  I&amp;rsquo;m glad PJ picked last night to be home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idea:  Compose a series of short stories, that will eventually become songs.  Then, write a series of songs that will eventually become short stories.  We&amp;rsquo;ll call this skill development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy caught me off guard the other night with the question: What is it about music that you feel emotionally connected to?  I gave him the answer that I&amp;rsquo;ve always believed, that music is a higher being.   He went to ask me if that meant that music was a better form of communication than words.  Too much one-dimensional thinking, and too much black-or-white.  (From Contact) I&amp;rsquo;ll never be able to articulate it, but every inch of me knows that it exists.  People don&amp;rsquo;t use the idea of God as a communication tool, they draw energy, love, whatever from that higher being which is available to them all the time, day or night.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, Andy said that to him, lightning is proof that there is a God.  To me, it&amp;rsquo;s all spread over different channels.  Lightning, music, particles.  Wherever it appears that is relative to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans for tonight:  Go to the library and pay for my overdue library books, check out new ones that I inevitably won&amp;rsquo;t read.  But it&amp;rsquo;s nice to know that they&amp;rsquo;re there.  I&amp;rsquo;ll see if I can find anything on Dark Matter.  Sleep, maybe try recording.  Head over to Scott&amp;rsquo;s to work out arrangements and sing a little.  Hopefully he&amp;rsquo;s written a song. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tommorow is the weekend.  This has been a long week. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Planting Seeds So My Trees Are Leafy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I might as well mention that London was full of fun. It was hot, and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t brought clothes for that sort of climate. No one in the UK has Air Conditioning either, so that didn&amp;rsquo;t make things any better. Liza came for a quick detour through DC before she went back to Minneapolis, and I won&amp;rsquo;t see her for another couple of months. I feel as if everytime we say hello, it&amp;rsquo;s goodbye again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;I might as well mention that London was full of fun. It was hot, and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t brought clothes for that sort of climate. No one in the UK has Air Conditioning either, so that didn&amp;rsquo;t make things any better. Liza came for a quick detour through DC before she went back to Minneapolis, and I won&amp;rsquo;t see her for another couple of months. I feel as if everytime we say hello, it&amp;rsquo;s goodbye again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got back, I bought myself a little tape recorder, just to sketch out musical ideas when I wasn&amp;rsquo;t near the studio. It has a USB plug so I can download sounds I record to my computer. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how useful it will be, but so far I&amp;rsquo;ve done a lot of sketching. Quick ideas and melodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy told me he wanted to record, so I quickly wrote a song and he came over. He sang it all wrong, coming in early, coming in late, until finally we gave up. Later I thought, what if I had let him continue singing the way he was, the way he was feeling the song moving was different than the way I was feeling it. So what if I let him do it that way, and sonically tried to match the song to his method of singing? Now that&amp;rsquo;s an idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I realized that the mixing process is something that I dread everytime, not because I&amp;rsquo;m not happy with my mixes, but because I have to transfer all the data from those zip disks to my hard drive, and it&amp;rsquo;s even harder with a mac since they only made the software for PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I went and bought one of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/FireWireSolo-main.html&#34; title=&#34;these bad boys.&#34;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;. The way my old studio was set up with the instruments plugged into a gigantic mixer/tracker with 8 open tracks, 4 if you wanted stereo tracks immediately. The tracking would occur on a zip disk, which didn&amp;rsquo;t fit much data anyway. Then, the zips go into a computer and the raw signal is transferred as a wave form to the pc. From there, I would load the wave forms into some sound editing software and proceed from there. With this bad boy, I&amp;rsquo;ve cut out the middle man completely. Now I can record my synth, guitar, and vocals all at the same time if I had that many arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night saw Click thanks to Aimee&amp;rsquo;s free passes. Went with Andy and we met Scott at the theater. I was expecting the usual Adam Sandler hokeyness, but what we got was a Christmas Carol-esque film that left you with a warm feeling in your heart, as most Adam Sandler movies do. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t groundbreaking, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad we saw it. Afterwards, dinner at Brio&amp;rsquo;s per Scott&amp;rsquo;s recommendation. I had the risotto, but Andy&amp;rsquo;s mushroom raviolli looked like it would suit me better. Afterwards, Andy and I tried to find the car for about an hour. We got a good luck at every side of the mall, until we found a security guard who drove us around until we found it. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve lost my dad&amp;rsquo;s nail clippers, after he made a huge deal about not losing them. And this time, it&amp;rsquo;s not as if I can&amp;rsquo;t remember where I put them. They must have fallen out of my cargo pockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So The Wranglers have their first and probably only gig at the Grog and Tankard on July 22. Another idea: form a band with no album or even any songs, create liner notes and an album title, decide who plays what. Decide what mood the songs will create and even make a discography of future records: where they are headed, which ones will be flops, which ones will be hits, and why the band will break up eventually. Get a gig, a huge one, where you have to have at least 20 people show up. Hype it up, make it sound like the event of the century, tell them about the wonderful songs you&amp;rsquo;ve written. Then begin writing and recording. What better way is there to start than from the end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drove Billy and Alex home the other night from Andy&amp;rsquo;s and Billy and I examined the new Paul Simon record a little. He finds it polished, and while I don&amp;rsquo;t disagree I haven&amp;rsquo;t really thought about how clean it sounds. It&amp;rsquo;s the arrangements and musical texture that I love. One of my favorite musicians with my favorite artist and some Herbie Hancock thrown in. Bliss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Eno, saw a really cool video today of him talking about the inspiration for Music for Airports. He said that he loves the design and the feel of airports, but the music they play is too happy – as if to say &amp;ldquo;you won&amp;rsquo;t die on this flight!&amp;rdquo; He thinks they should play music that&amp;rsquo;s a little more realistic, more &amp;ldquo;you are about to sit in space for a few hours.&amp;rdquo; So there&amp;rsquo;s no happiness in the piece, there&amp;rsquo;s no sadness, there&amp;rsquo;s just this feeling of suspension. I hope I&amp;rsquo;ve made it clear how much I love this guy. I got excited because I read today that he has another book coming out, but in 2008 because he&amp;rsquo;s spending 2007 writing it, day by day, the same way he wrote the last one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My meeting with Rick went well. I think he wants to use basecamp and zoho for data and collaboration, minus some of the more sensitive stuff, but still useful. I think he liked what I had to say about an emphasis on programming rather than mundane tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had soup today that was excellent. I dipped crackers in it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, Kellyn, Andy, and I sat outside on a really clear night, and over the course of their visit the clouds lowered and there was strong fog everywhere. It made me really inspired to compose something from the eyes of the frog on the wall, who saw the whole thing. So, the next piece in the Still Life record. There&amp;rsquo;s a bit of silence at the beginning and end because I&amp;rsquo;m tired and haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to edit it. This picture is from a flickr page.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a little over a week since I arrived in the UK, but it feels much longer due to the way I&amp;rsquo;ve worked out our living schedule. This entry could be quite long, so I&amp;rsquo;ve marked it with subheadings. Feel free to pick and choose, or to carry on with your day at work or wherever you may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrival at Heathrow&amp;rsquo;s and Riz Mamoo&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 1: My flight was delayed about an hour due to an indication problem. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what that meant but we had to refuel at one point. Anyway, they played the news (BBC) and then got on to the movies. The selection was pretty weak, so I ended up starting off with Freedomland, where Julianne Moore and Sammy L. do something dramatic, and then I moved on to Last Vacation, where Queen Latifah and LL Cool J attempted to be comedic. Still can&amp;rsquo;t believe that LL would think himself good enough to be on screen. Read for a little bit (social life of information) and slept maybe an hour. The flight was 6.5 hours, much shorter than normal, and much shorter than the return flight, which is scheduled for 8 hours now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The flight was 6.5 hours, much shorter than normal, and much shorter than the return flight, which is scheduled for 8 hours now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived at Heathrow around 10pm, and went through passport control (customs) and headed out to the arrival area, where Liza was waiting for me. It&amp;rsquo;s always surreal whenever I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen her for 5 months – everything and nothing has changed. She had taken a night train from Paris after backpacking for a while. We met my uncle and grandmother outside and headed back to his place. I&amp;rsquo;ve never been here as a driver, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think I could handle the left side thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrive at mamoo&amp;rsquo;s house and it&amp;rsquo;s everything you&amp;rsquo;d expect it an english townhouse to be. Apparently, Arisha (4 years old) had waited up for me but eventually fell asleep. At the last minute, she thought that maybe she had mistaken my identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to see Zia bhai! I love Zia bhai!! … is he a boy? does he have short hair?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liza and I stayed in the attic-room. It was pretty warm, it turns out that we brought the DC weather, and it&amp;rsquo;s been like that ever since we arrived here. Who&amp;rsquo;d have thought there would be cloudless days everyday in the UK?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day #2:  We woke up early to go have Dim-sum (chinese breakfast) in Chinatown.  Arisha was as cute as ever.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>People Get Old Air Is Less Cold New Wave Drinking Games</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/posts/2006-06-01-people-get-old-air-is-less-cold-new-wave-drinking-games/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the couse of the year, I noticed that time was moving forward at a breakneck pace. I thought maybe it was factors like my classes being later in the day (spending more time sleeping, less time awake). But in the summer, I&amp;rsquo;m waking up at 7 every day, and it&amp;rsquo;s still flying by very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two nights ago, on the brink of May 31st, we had a small get together at my house, to bring in Andy&amp;rsquo;s birthday. I invited Kevin, who I haven&amp;rsquo;t really talked to in almost a decade. He was kind enough to bring a sixpack of Negro. All of us had a great time, and the air was really warm. We saw a flicker of fireflies in the trees – a preview for what will come in July. Around midnight, we decided to get some fast food. Stood in the drive through at Wendy&amp;rsquo;s with no significant outcome. Chris drove us there like a soccer mom in his station wagon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Last night: Andy&amp;rsquo;s house for more celebration of birthday. It was Billy&amp;rsquo;s too, so we enjoyed more hookah and beer pong on Andy&amp;rsquo;s deck. Beer pong is really &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;juvenille&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; sophisticated and classy. I won&amp;rsquo;t ever be accepted as a &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;bro-bro&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; college kid unless I enjoy beer pong. The game is really &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;lame and unnecessary&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; exciting, and there&amp;rsquo;s really &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;a million better ways to drink beer&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; no better party game. If you&amp;rsquo;ve spent the time to perfect your beer pong game, you probably &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t have any useful talents&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; have a gift, and should be worshipped by the rest of your &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;artificial&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; friends. Since beer pong is &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;a win-win situation&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; highly competitive, it may sound weird that I&amp;rsquo;d rather have my opponent kick my ass since the point is to &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;drink beer, an activity which is a simple process for most &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; sink as many cups as you can. Since I&amp;rsquo;m not really good at the game, I consider myself to be a &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;winner, because I end up drinking more than my opponent&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; loser, and I should be ashamed. Based on interviews with players about their ability/skill/talent with Beirut, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that the average beer pong player thinks that they are &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&amp;ldquo;fucking amazing&amp;rdquo; and _&amp;quot;_own the table&amp;quot;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; among fierce competition when they go to parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose there is a certain amount of boredom associated with drinking beer when there are no real constraints or consequences. Think of it as liberating. You can&amp;rsquo;t touch your drink unless the rules permit. Unless you draw a king, you can only drink &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; many sips, or unless your partner sinks the cup, your BAC is at a halt. Now, you no longer abide by another&amp;rsquo;s set of pointless rules – you can drink when you please, and how much you please. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to chug whatever is in the cup all at once because someone else&amp;rsquo;s rules say so. You can drink from a bottle, or a mug if you&amp;rsquo;d like. You can spend an entire night drinking a 12 oz. bottle of Corona, or you can have a 6 pack of Corrs Light in 30 minutes. The choice is yours, and no one can judge you for it, or say that you&amp;rsquo;re a winner or loser. You just are. Sounds better than a man law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still – we can reinvent a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All players begin by drinking 2-3 beers at their own pace. Each player has a team-mate. Team Member A writes down an adjective and Team Member B writes down a noun and keeps it to themselves. During this process, no laughter is allowed, not even a giggle. Once everyone has written their combination, all of the combinations are read out loud, one by one. Laughter can be used, and will most likely ensue – during which the team members who wrote the combination must drink without pause. Once the last person stops laughing, the players must stop drinking. Players who are known to be witty, humorous, or players who have excellent delivery, are encouraged to keep a lot of extra beer in their cup as a precaution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players must follow the rules of Texas Hold Em for this game. Each player has two cups, one is 1/2 full of beer, and the other is 1/8. You may use more beer as long as the proportions are correct. Hands are dealt, and players place their cards face down in front of each of the cups. The dealer has 5 special cups. Two of these special cups are filled with a lot of liquid, the other three are filled with significantly less liquid. The cups must be covered in a way that players do not know which cup contains more. Whoever has the winning the hand then drinks whatever cups correspond to the cards in his hand. Whoever has the worst hand must drink the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players must be engaged in active conversation while sipping on their beers, but nobody must use any cuss words in their conversations. Players can go out of their way to use obvious replacements, such as &amp;ldquo;flippin,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;shnikes,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;darn&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;biatch.&amp;rdquo; Beers should not be chugged – they should be consumed at a medium pace. When a beer is finished, the player who finished it must nonchalantly mention a curse word in the conversation. Then, each player must say a cuss word. The last person to catch on must drink all of the beer left in the other players&amp;rsquo; cups. If a player cusses before he or she has finished their drink, they are in charge of refilling everyone&amp;rsquo;s drink for the next round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A table is set up, exactly like a Beer Pong table, except instead of a v shape, the cups are set randomly across the table. Dark cups must be used, so players cannot see how much liquid is in the cup just by looking at the side. Beer is poured into half of the cups, and the other half remain empty. Cards from the first deck are placed on the rims of the glass face up. Those corresponding cards are then divided among the players, at random. The players use their &amp;ldquo;hand&amp;rdquo; to take the cups that belong to them (the cards they have match the cards sitting on the cups). If a player is lucky, he will get the majority of the full cups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catch is, that if the loser wants to have some of the winner&amp;rsquo;s earnings, he or she may do so if the winner allows it. The amount of cups that the loser is allowed to drink must be repaid eventually, in the next round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a really funny short story on enoweb.co.uk about Eno&amp;rsquo;s return to Roxy Music (his first band, the one that got him famous). It&amp;rsquo;s based on the Da Vinci Code, and involves Eno talking to interviewers about not getting back together with Roxy… and then coming up to a screen with the words Roxy Music flashing. I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand it since I&amp;rsquo;ve never read the Da Vinci Code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans for tonight: hang out with Chris, maybe PJ, maybe others for one last blast of summer before I head to rainy London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was hot today. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Scorchingly&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Killingly hot. For the first time this year, I felt the Sauna of my car as I sat down, the stickiness of the steering wheel burning my skin off, avoiding the seatbelt as I clicked in. And that lovely two-minute wait between total AC oasis and standing-on-the-sun boil.&lt;br&gt;
Friday night: Chris and I went to Tower and I bought a random Eno DVD, two video paintings that ended up being quite strange and I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it was worth the money I spent. We sat on the deck with no hookah for once, but we drank beer instead. Heineken Light and Corona. We watched &amp;ldquo;What the @#%$ do we know?&amp;rdquo; and I fell asleep, even though I love that movie.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We watched &amp;ldquo;What the @#%$ do we know?&amp;rdquo; and I fell asleep, even though I love that movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday night: Went to PJ&amp;rsquo;s around 9 or so, and he had a special movie for us to watch, turns out it was Ninja Turtles, the first one. There are some absolutely fantastic lines in that movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh guys, this may not be uh, structurally speaking, the best time for your buddies to uh, drop in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, Casey Jones being a claustrophobic, and so instead of sleeping in the gigantic sewer living room, he squeezes into his tiny car. Not to mention that the scar Splinter leaves on Shredder&amp;rsquo;s face won&amp;rsquo;t go away after all these years. Even if I could suspend my disbelief about th scar, the Shredder didn&amp;rsquo;t use logical or conventional methods to cover it. Instead, he wears blades on his shoulders, a mask that makes him sound like Darth Vader, and a long trash-bag cape. I really wish Kraang had made an appearance in the movies – he was that talking brain that was behind Shredder&amp;rsquo;s plans – and don&amp;rsquo;t try to tell me that it would be too unbelievable. There are men in turtle costumes, and a large talking rat. The subsequent movie was great, as I remember it, and I&amp;rsquo;ll probably rent it again sometime soon. The third one was kind of like the third Back to the Future, not because it involved time travel but it was completely out of place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m at work now listening to Eno &amp;amp; Fripp&amp;rsquo;s Evening Star. I remember searching high and low for this album, and finally finding it in tower. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty much everything you could want from Robert Fripp in terms of washing the guitar over Eno&amp;rsquo;s soundscape. I&amp;rsquo;m kind of considering starting an Eno fansite, even though there&amp;rsquo;s an amazing one that exists already called Enoweb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had conversation with a few people recently, concerning my obsession with Eno. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I know anyone besides Chris who enjoys listening to it, and that&amp;rsquo;s really understandable. Eno&amp;rsquo;s not a master musician. In fact, he&amp;rsquo;s pretty talentless when it comes to singing or playing. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard &amp;ldquo;By This River,&amp;rdquo; you know that the piano part isn&amp;rsquo;t anything complicated, and a 10-year old piano student could plunk it out if he had 30 minutes to spare. He sings occasionally, and though I&amp;rsquo;ve grown to love his voice, there&amp;rsquo;s no way I&amp;rsquo;d play it for someone and expect them to be impressed or intrigued. The people he works with (Harold Budd, Robert Fripp, David Bowie, David Byrne, Talking Heads, U2, Paul Simon, Cluster, Jon Hassell, Jah Wobble) are all fantastic musicians, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What he does, though, is create pieces of sound that transcend a lot of ideas about music. He writes with such a different mindset than a lot of writers. It&amp;rsquo;s not always about the song. It&amp;rsquo;s about what it was intended for, who it was intended for, what function it serves, if any. Like his collaborations with Harold Budd (The Pearl, Plataeux of Mirror). Take a listen to a solo recording of Harold Budd (La Bella Vista, for example. Very cool idea – Daniel Lanois invited these gorgeous women over to his house, and asked Budd to play new songs for them. So he was under pressure, and Lanois and Eno recorded the whole thing secretly. Either way, there&amp;rsquo;s no extra production done to these recordings, but that&amp;rsquo;s a concept, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? Putting the musician in a spot, candidly, and putting him under incredible pressure to perform well. That type of stuff isn&amp;rsquo;t at all musical.) Anyway, take a solo record from Budd and then listen to one of the two he did with Eno. You listen to his solo recording, and his lovely and fluid way of playing the piano, the compositions which mix jazz/classical/new age elements. Then, you hear the stuff with Eno. Every key that&amp;rsquo;s hit is so colorful, so perfect, there&amp;rsquo;s a hazy synth off in the background like a sunset. It&amp;rsquo;s the placement of everything that&amp;rsquo;s so fantastic, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve listened for since I was a kid. I used to love it when I wore out a tape I had gotten tired of. It added this whole new weird dimension to it – the warbling of the music as the tape passed. And to the idea that Eno could take a shit on a record and call it his creation? Yes, he could. So could you. That&amp;rsquo;s another thing – listening to his music/reading his book has made me realize that art can&amp;rsquo;t really be examined from one view. People do it to create pleasure, but another way of thinking about it is: how do I illuminate the pleasure that&amp;rsquo;s dormant but available? So if you&amp;rsquo;ve totally immersed yourself in this stuff, and still want to hate, it won&amp;rsquo;t bother me. But, just like any problem/situation/idea, it should be looked at from all angles, even ones you never knew existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday night: pre-party at Jon&amp;rsquo;s house with lots of Yueng Ling, great food, and good friends. We went to Hometown Holidays after that, and I had my annual rendevouz with Stiles and Schlaf. Also ran into Amy Lieberman (not Liza&amp;rsquo;s mom). Aimee came with. Blues Traveler was fun, and the best part about the whole show was that it was an hour long. After that, we played on Jon&amp;rsquo;s deck for a bit, and Tony came over. Chris and Aimee slept over and we watched the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday: Aimee and I met Billy at Potbelly, and after eating three wrecks between the three of us, Aimee and I saw Mission Impossible 3, which was actually pretty entertaining. Tom Cruise always looks like he&amp;rsquo;s about to cry. Even when he&amp;rsquo;s smiling. Ryan says it&amp;rsquo;s the aliens inside him. Nonetheless, the story was fun, and Laurence Fishburne&amp;rsquo;s tooth gap was wide. I got a haircut – I now have sideburns again, like in high school, and a mini goat. Went to Scott/Mike/Ed&amp;rsquo;s to enjoy the night and hang out, and then came home. At about midnight, Billy and I randomly go to Andy&amp;rsquo;s house for late night hookah. It was one of the nicest experiences I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had this summer, and a lot of it was due to the weather. We laughed about funny things. I want to record the frog noises from Andy&amp;rsquo;s yard and use it for Still Life. Wish I had that Talkboy. It was based on the type of spontaneity that summer is made of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans for today: hang out with Chris and/or PJ. Find a way to cure my boredom at work. Figure out why my server isn&amp;rsquo;t working. Look at reviews on Amazon for records I already own. Think about being with Liza soon, 4 days 1 hour 42 minutes 22 seconds from now to be exact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toad show on Friday and I finally have a show-partner, Sami. I&amp;rsquo;m glad that it&amp;rsquo;s someone who is as big of a Toad as fan as I am.&lt;br&gt;
Just a sidenote: you can post comments in this log whether you&amp;rsquo;re a wordpress member or not. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to, of course, but I just thought I&amp;rsquo;d make it clear.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week was fast, this day has gone really fast, this year went by the fastest. It feels like decades ago now, last summer with my trip to Minneapolis, Astronomy class, RA training, saying goodbye to everyone. At the same time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know this is how empty being a senior feels. I still have 10 more classes to take, and since they&amp;rsquo;re intense, I expect to be satisfied from what I learn next year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

At the same time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know this is how empty being a senior feels. I still have 10 more classes to take, and since they&amp;rsquo;re intense, I expect to be satisfied from what I learn next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night: drove to DC around dinnertime to eat Chinese food with scott. Met his new roommates briefly, and then headed to the roof to noodle with guitars for a bit. Wish I had known that was going to happen, I would&amp;rsquo;ve come prepared. So many different musical things happening at once, I&amp;rsquo;m working on Still Life, but today I begin writing songs for a vocal/guitar trio. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any of Mike&amp;rsquo;s songs to listen to or learn, but from what I&amp;rsquo;ve heard they&amp;rsquo;re just these awesome straight up rock songs, with solid harmonies and 90&amp;rsquo;s-like hooks. Scott can play guitar really well. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if he considers himself to have great chops, but he plays with feeling, which will come in handy. Also, he has some great chord progressions that can be turned into songs. The songs, though, and I&amp;rsquo;ve decided I want all my songs to be like this from now on, will be logical. They&amp;rsquo;ll flow within each other and make sense. Probably lots of hanging upper parts and moving middle parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw X3, which was slightly disappointing. I think most would agree that all of the events didn&amp;rsquo;t connect well and there was a lot of potential. On the other hand, it&amp;rsquo;s a movie about mutants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been considering changing my recording process a little whenever I write a new song. Of course, lately it&amp;rsquo;s been different as it is, but I&amp;rsquo;m referring to those times when I&amp;rsquo;ll write a song with four or five chords and track it, mix it, and have an mp3 ready all in one night. I mean, maybe I can still do that, but I think I&amp;rsquo;d like to start experimenting with Reason a little more. Coming up with chords is fine, but maybe starting off with some work in the sequencer, exporting a track and sending it to zip disk, recording vocals and guitar over that and then spending a considerable amount of time mixing might be a better way to go. I can&amp;rsquo;t do the same thing forever. It will make the process a little more tedious, but I&amp;rsquo;m prepared for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussion between Scott and I yesterday: as we get older, it becomes more difficult for us to attach ourselves emotionally to a piece of music. His theory is that when we&amp;rsquo;re younger, we can&amp;rsquo;t express exactly how we feel, and so when the music does that bit for us, we&amp;rsquo;re gratified. Maybe, but I&amp;rsquo;m not so sure. For instance, it was really easy for me to compose pieces of music when I was 6. And everything I wrote was gold to me, because it was mine. Obviously, that&amp;rsquo;s not the case anymore – it takes a lot to impress myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Eno has released a computer program, which just like his music, doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a particular purpose, other than to color the backdrop of everyday life. Basically, he&amp;rsquo;s taken a series of images and made it so that this program can produce 77 million different images. I want to buy the DVD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got an invite to Moola.com. Basically, their revenue model is advertising based, and they give you a penny when you register. You play a 2 player game with someone who also has that amount, and whoever wins takes all the money. Then you play someone who has two cents, so on and so forth. It&amp;rsquo;s online gambling without actually paying. Instead, you view an ad before every game that you play. You can cash out at anytime and make a max of 10 million dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans for tonight: Hang out with Chris and PJ (who is home?) and maybe go to Tower records. It&amp;rsquo;ll start to feel a little more like summer now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of downtime at work, lately. So much, in fact, that I&amp;rsquo;ve been archiving all of my livejournal entries in this log. I always thought it&amp;rsquo;d be fun to look at old entries, and it was. I was a pretty melodramatic/attention craving high schooler – most of my posts were about how much I hated my life, how much I wanted a girl, theater drama, and songwriting. What&amp;rsquo;s interesting: whenever someone asks me about high school, what I thought of it, I always say that I enjoyed it. When I think back, I don&amp;rsquo;t remember all of this loneliness and depression. I remember the good friends, the ones that&amp;rsquo;ve stuck, and some of the ones that haven&amp;rsquo;t. And for the record, I love my life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;ve archived it and indexed all the entries by tags on the main page of this log. You can look for your name and probably find posts that pertain to you. I&amp;rsquo;ve made the tags as detailed as possible so I can revisit memories whenever I feel like visiting. I&amp;rsquo;ve only archived up to mid-2003 because the process invovles a lot of reading. Just makes me want to write more though, so I can come back to it later. Give the idea of &amp;ldquo;blogging&amp;rdquo; some meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saw Chris and Andy tonight, unexpectedely, because I thought Andy had work and Chris originally had other plans. Chris&amp;rsquo; call woke me from a 3 hour nap that I took after work. I haven&amp;rsquo;t done that sort of thing in a while, it was refreshing. We smoked an apple-orange-mandarin mix on my deck. Speaking of which, I want to try and cut down the amount of shisha I smoke to once a week, if that. It&amp;rsquo;s a good thing that this habit doesn&amp;rsquo;t continue during the school year. A trip to McDonalds afterward to satisfy the hunger, and a conversation about drunk driving laws.  Andy suggested that the government only get involved when there&amp;rsquo;s an accident due to drunk driving, rather than enforce the blood-alcohol level limit.  It&amp;rsquo;s absurd to me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to continue reading my book, and probably watching Alias before heading to bed. Plans for tommorow: watch Fast Cheap and Out of Control with Andy and/or Chris. Work is becoming more bearable everyday, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back at home, and while we were gone, summer decided to creep up and take form. It&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily temperature – today wasn&amp;rsquo;t excruciatingly warm as summer in North Potomac normally is, but it was the sun that got me. Especially around sunset, it hangs above everything like it&amp;rsquo;s checking over everyone before it says goodnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vacation was an overall success. The last night we were in Ocean City, we played Texas Hold &amp;lsquo;Em. My sister kept getting pocket ___&amp;rsquo;s and I kept getting full houses. Weird. It comes back to the question: do you deal the cards or do the cards deal you? Then, we watched an episode of the Office and drifted off to our rooms for the night.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Before I went to sleep, I wanted to listen to some music, and my Creative wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get past the boot screen. I did hard resets, nothing worked. A note to anyone looking to buy an mp3 player: stay away from Creative. iRiver is apparnetly trustworthy, and I&amp;rsquo;ve heard mixed things about iPod. Nonetheless, it gave me an excuse to get a new one – can you guess which one I chose? It&amp;rsquo;s white, stores 30 gb of music (less some space allocated for the firmware), and plays video. The battery life on the iPod isn&amp;rsquo;t as much as on the Creative, but I found a neat invention called the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.batterygeek.net/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=GeekPod100&#34;&gt;Geekpod.&lt;/a&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s the size of an ipod, but it will keep the thing charged for about 100 hours, supposedely. It&amp;rsquo;s about 70 bucks, but that almost seems worth it if you take long trips or something. Thing is, I&amp;rsquo;d only really need it for my london trip, but I think that the player should be able to handle the plane trip of 7 hours. The one true advantage is that the Geekpod gives you 12 hours of video playback, not including the 2 that a normal charge on the pod will give you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought more books in Ocean City. &lt;em&gt;Specimen Days&lt;/em&gt; by Michael Cunningham is about a person who is reborn in 3 different time periods, always New York, and has a strange connection to Walt Whitman&amp;rsquo;s poems. I figure that I&amp;rsquo;ll read this on the way to or on the way back from London. Also got a book called Astonish Yourself, by a french philosopher. It describes ways to think that are bizarre and often uncomfortable. I&amp;rsquo;m really into this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Urinate while drinking. Feel all the organs in between your mouth and your out-spout. You&amp;rsquo;ve never felt so together, so in place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call out your name repeatedely. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried this and it is absolutely bizarre. At first, you feel silly. Then, you start to feel as if it&amp;rsquo;s someone else calling to you, and you wonder why you aren&amp;rsquo;t responding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lie down on a hill looking at the stars. Then, once you&amp;rsquo;ve registered that view, imagine (or realize, really) that you&amp;rsquo;re strapped against the bottom of the earth due to gravity, and therefore you&amp;rsquo;re actually staring &lt;em&gt;down&lt;/em&gt; at the stars. Swallow that one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invent lives for yourself. You come up with elaborate stories, with perfect details, stuff that never actually happened… but you&amp;rsquo;re going to assume that they did. Since memories are never &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; anyway, and if everyone believes that the events you create did occur, why wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you believe it yourself?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I went to the Wellness Center to receive a massage. My back has been terribly tight in the past couple months or so, and I figured that having some of the knots undone would really help. It felt great, but the knots are still there, and my neck still cracks everytime I look down. Maybe I need a chiropractor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, Marian (therapist) was telling me about a museum in Florida, which has real bodies that are somehow preserved. The curators rip open the flesh so you can see the veins, muscles, and tissue visibly. They leave the eyes and teeth in. To a massage therapist, or a radial nerve palsy survivor, this could be one of the most interesting things in the world. To the normal person, it&amp;rsquo;s inhumane and/or downright gross. Here&amp;rsquo;s an &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;image.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; Remember that this was a real person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the stunt kite that Liza gave me for my 19th birthday in my basement and the wind&amp;rsquo;s been nice lately so I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of putting it together and trying it out, even though I know NOTHING about stunts. I want to get one of those kites that just hovers really high in the air. I want to smoke shisha and fly a kite on my deck. Is that too much to ask?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally. A pack of chicklets that has a green one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two nights ago, Chris and I met up with Tanya and Martita at Bennigan&amp;rsquo;s after searching at Barnes and Noble (like I need more books right now). We drove back to my house to smoke weed flavored shisha. I don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy getting really high anymore. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a combination of the resulting paranoia and goofy mess that I become. That being said though, the amount of &amp;ldquo;flavoring&amp;rdquo; was so small compared to the tobacco that it provided a mini-buzz that was absolutely perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, watched the season finale of 24 with Mariam, who I watched the Season 4 finale with as well (back when my arm was broken and I didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about 24). It was definitely the best two episodes of the season – Jack&amp;rsquo;s been holding back I guess. I love Jean Smart. We finished up with some of The Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Donahue finally fixed my speaker problem (they didn&amp;rsquo;t work). Now I can listen to KCRW&amp;rsquo;s Morning Becomes Eclectic. I heard a fantastic artist/song this morning by the name of Nerrina Pallot. I think she&amp;rsquo;s from the UK and she&amp;rsquo;s doing a show the day that I get there. Unfortunately I get in after the show&amp;rsquo;s finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan for tonight: Possibly drag Chris into a DC adventure with Scott, Ed, and Mike. Before that though, I intend on doing some summer cleaning of my computer and my hard drive. I realize that I have some really tasteless music scattered all over the thing. Best option would be to archive (DVD) a bunch of music I don&amp;rsquo;t need or want anymore, and just go on a downloading spree on the Anti-music hub (treasure trove for unknown/rare artists).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small note about Still Life. My next goal is to make a longer piece, and bring Chris into the session, as well as someone who knows nothing about the structure of music. This person could be good at something else. Running, perhaps. Drawing, prose, or math. This is becoming a cross-collaborative process. Not only are we extracting music from photography, but we&amp;rsquo;re using perceptions of photography and how images should sound from people with very different mindsets. I want to cultivate and control that gap. Widen it, narrow it, see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week is halfway over tommorow, which means that I&amp;rsquo;ve got 8 more days of work until I get on a plane to go to London. Summer – so many colors and textures to choose from. I&amp;rsquo;m making a gorgeous painting. If only the other guys were around to enjoy it with me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine my surprise today when we walked into, not a hotel room, but my uncle&amp;rsquo;s condo, complete with wireless internet access and a widescreen TV, bags of chips, my own bedroom, a balcony with a view of the sea, and various other awesome components. I could make a habit out of this place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got a late start getting out of north potomac, and of course, mom was freaking out about it, but still was very adamant about getting to the outlet mall. In the car ride to the outlet mall, I listened to the Incredible Moses Leroy&amp;rsquo;s album Become the Soft Lightes. A sidenote: this band is really unknown, and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have known about them if Utkarsh hadn&amp;rsquo;t brought them up. If anyone enjoys good synth-pop, check it out. Probably one of my favorite albums. Either way, I did some research since they haven&amp;rsquo;t released anything since &amp;lsquo;03, turns out that they&amp;rsquo;ve actually changed their name to the Soft Lightes (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.myspace.com/thesoftlightes)&#34;&gt;http://www.myspace.com/thesoftlightes)&lt;/a&gt;. Even weirder was that they were playing a track from the album on the radio at the outlet mall. I flipped out and caused a commotion, but isn&amp;rsquo;t that weird?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Even weirder was that they were playing a track from the album on the radio at the outlet mall. I flipped out and caused a commotion, but isn&amp;rsquo;t that weird?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the outlet mall, I purchased two books for good prices. Freakonomics by Steven Levitt and The World is Flat by Thomas Friedman. My sister and father are both on the waiting list for Freakonomics after reading the inside flap. Also have to get through the rest of Social Life of Information. I actually forgot where I got that one – I have a feeling it was Kraemer&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way up to Ocean City, I listened to (while dozing in and out) Paul Simon&amp;rsquo;s surprises. Caught the end of the album this time and I have to say that I really love it. Think I&amp;rsquo;m going to buy it for dad on Father&amp;rsquo;s day. We got into the beach area, and discovered that there are a lot of loud cars in Ocean City. Scared the daylight out of mom. Me too, I&amp;rsquo;ll admit it. Also, we noticed a lot of rednecks on the side of the road watching cars go by, with video cameras. It seemed a little odd, and there were a lot of them, like there was some invisible parade happening, or like they were camping out for concert tickets. We walked down the boardwalk and witnessed a Christian Kareoke singer (Jesus died for us), Thrasher Fries (Boardwalk&amp;rsquo;s only competitor, and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure we&amp;rsquo;re their only customer), a shaved ice (it was huge and lime), and a good talk with Aleena about motivation and college (private details). Ended up at a restaurant called Galaxy (Dad had heard about the wonderful jazz there) and we got Crab Soup, and I ordered the Boullabaise. Wasn&amp;rsquo;t too filling, wasn&amp;rsquo;t lacking either. Dad got an Amstel Light and I ordered a Corona with Lime in a hurricane glass. It&amp;rsquo;s our vacation, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our waitress informed us that it was &amp;ldquo;Classic Car Weekend,&amp;rdquo; which is a holiday that Ocean city has where people bring their antique cars down for the spectators (rednecks with Beer coolers who stand on the side of the road with video cameras). After dinner, Aleena and I caught a few episodes of 24 (I love hooking my laptop up to external monitors, especially when that monitor happens to be a widescreen television), and Dad fell asleep on my shoulder. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to be with family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans for tommorow: Play foxtail on the beach, shoot the skyrocket a few times, read some books while tanning (blackening), beat Megaman and watch more 24. I actually added those things to my blackberry&amp;rsquo;s tasklist because it current had no active tasks and well, I want anyone who looks at my to-do list to be sure that I&amp;rsquo;m on vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I met up tonight with an assortment of people. David and Andy came over, and there was a short cameo from Ashley Pearson. We listened to some Eno and relaxed on the deck, and Andy was really interested in getting some ideas down in Reason. So the three of us whipped out the synth and spread Reason out across two monitors and began working, generating ideas, passing around the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

So the three of us whipped out the synth and spread Reason out across two monitors and began working, generating ideas, passing around the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We checked out one of David&amp;rsquo;s friend&amp;rsquo;s pictures (search for Rumpid on deviantart.com) and found a really interesting picture of a lamp, in pieces, put on a bed. It reminded all of us of vacating and leaving old lives to start new ones, or reclaim old ones. Then we started to turn the gears a bit: Andy&amp;rsquo;s seed started the whole thing, a short chord progression that he had dreamed while we were on the deck. I have a feeling it was searching through the library of sounds that inspired the specific notes that he played, but they set a great backdrop for David to add his part. David brought color to the whole thing: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to play one note, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know which one&amp;rdquo; (Which, by the way, is the best way to make this sort of music). Throughout the piece you&amp;rsquo;ll hear this gorgeous dissonant bell, which David is responsible for. I sat at the helm and did a lot of clicking, a lot of copying and pasting, and I added the rhythmic bits for cohesiveness. We all sort of came together on the random sounds to tie the piece together. The title was half mine (first half) and half David&amp;rsquo;s idea (other half). So, this was a little more elaborate than the previous piece I wrote for the Still Life project, but definitely a fun experience. It&amp;rsquo;s best heard on headphones with the volume on medium-low. Please leave comments if you liked it or hated it. Right click and save target as to keep it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s awfully weird being here without a broken arm/dysfunctional hand. Also, not having PJ or Chris here is uncomfortable – there is no one to eat lunch with, not to mention that I forgot the code to the lunchroom. Additionally, last year when I was bored, I just surfed the internet looking for information about &lt;a href=&#34;http://health.allrefer.com/health/radial-nerve-dysfunction-info.html&#34;&gt;radial nerve palsy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means is that I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to write some updates everyday. It&amp;rsquo;s a good thing that I&amp;rsquo;m not on livejournal. It began to weird me out that everytime I felt like posting it would appear on a bunch of different friend pages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Today at work: PJ called and impersonated a weichert exec, something he&amp;rsquo;s particularly good at. I got the day off Friday which means less money and more time for vacation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans for tonight: Go to the library and get some more books with mass amounts of code in them so I can be really knowledgeable about SQL and programming databases. Maybe Andy will come over at some point. And maybe I will nap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans for tommorow night: Jammin&amp;rsquo; Java with Laura Marc to see Laura Veirs. I promised to buy her a drink – is this 21 thing getting old? No, I&amp;rsquo;m just getting old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened to the joy of summer? So far, the transition has left me feeling a bit underwhelmed. I counted and I have exactly 9 weeks here. Divided in half, that&amp;rsquo;s 4.5, which means a nice end of summer paycheck. I wonder if AU will give me a paycheck for July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to stop being bored and start being amazed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Schools Out</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last time I wrote here, I was in the middle of finals. Things have cleared up since then, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been sleeping a good 8-9 hours a night. It&amp;rsquo;s very refereshing. This entry will be a former draft combined with some new insight, so it may become confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember going into my first scheduling meeting and feeling extremely out of place. I was worried about getting too many graveyard shifts being a newbie, and ended up voluntarily taking two 5:30 shifts during the week, and a 7:30. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d get an early start to my day. I was working in Letts, living in Leonard. Weird, because I am going to live in Letts and work in Leonard. And other Northside halls.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The end of the academic year is always strange. Especially being an RA, watching everyone leave. I took a 5am shift today, for old times sake. Surprisingly, whenever I wake up at 5am, I&amp;rsquo;m more awake than I am if I wake up at 11 or something. Also, there are less people to deal with. I remember during my Letts shifts, I used to watch a full movie in the two hours that I was on duty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took my Operations exam on Monday, and felt really smart. Turns out I&amp;rsquo;ve actually learned quite a bit from Dr. Selman. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those classes that I apply to everyday life all the time. Queueing theory and decision making, especially. After that, I turned in my e-commerce paper on Arrow Electronics, and my final. I felt fantastic, and began studying really hard for the Marketing exam which I did alright on. I think I managed to mess up the final essay question and probably some of the math questions. So I guess we&amp;rsquo;ll have to see how that one turns out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I went to On the Border with Aimee, Ryan, and Josh (ryan&amp;rsquo;s roommate), and had the &amp;ldquo;Ultimate Fajita.&amp;rdquo; It became the ultimate vomit this morning before I had my shift. Then we went to a very empty room in Anderson, followed by McDonalds. The McDonalds probably wasn&amp;rsquo;t the greatest idea in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am supposed to make a proposal to the head of Housing and Dining programs in June at some point, which is exciting. So many ideas have been rattling around ever since I created that bi-weekly facilities app. I&amp;rsquo;ve started writing a document of security related desk/floor management procedures, as that&amp;rsquo;s Rick&amp;rsquo;s main concern right now. It should be, and I think that will probably be my hardest challenge. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about some inernal systems, like a key check-out program. I found a neat little site called ZohoCreator, which lets you create web forms and insert the code snippet on any html, create users and specify their access levels, and best of all, it lets you export any data collected to an excel spreadsheet. I think, though, that I&amp;rsquo;d rather use MySQL. Even though I know very little about database management right now, I&amp;rsquo;d rather be accountable for things on my own server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, we ate dinner with Sarah&amp;rsquo;s family and her 3 adorable cousins who wanted to arm wrestle. I kept &amp;ldquo;letting them win.&amp;rdquo; Then Mike and I watched a rather disturbing video of an arm wrestling match in which the smaller guy&amp;rsquo;s arm snaps at the elbow. The reaction from the other guy in the room is &amp;ldquo;Call the police!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans for today: Take down all the junk in my hallway. The butcher paper, the bulletin boards, the random stuff. Do a sweep of the entire building in the early evening. Plans for tommorow: wake up, say goodbye to the leonard staff, go to Weichert. Then the real summer beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upcoming events: trip to London/Scotland on June 3rd, Toad the Wet Sprocket on June 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Summer Hides</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There have been times over the past few months where I’ve really considered writing in this blog again, only to have some new project or obligation arrive at my doorstep in a package with a bow. I’m not apologizing, but miss tying these threads together. It’s not lack of time – writing a few paragraphs doesn’t take a while. It’s actually organizing and reflecting on what’s been happening lately, the whirlwind that the end of the semester has created, and logging it all. Logging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;There have been times over the past few months where I’ve really considered writing in this blog again, only to have some new project or obligation arrive at my doorstep in a package with a bow. I’m not apologizing, but miss tying these threads together. It’s not lack of time – writing a few paragraphs doesn’t take a while. It’s actually organizing and reflecting on what’s been happening lately, the whirlwind that the end of the semester has created, and logging it all. Logging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a fantastic week. We had our final concert on the last day of class and we felt like rockstars. The studio has been a much more interesting experience this time around – more talent, more microphones, old-school engineer, etc. Seventeen songs sounded ambitious to most of us, and to our prorcer, but we managed to get most of the tracking done in the 20 hours we had allocated (a couple of us head back for an extra hour of tracking on Wednesday, and then the mixing process begins). We had spent a couple hundred dollars trying to get a feel for what mixing would be like. According to the technicians, the less time spent mixing, the sloppier the final product. Maybe I shouldn’t have placed as much blame as I did on Archie’s lack of experience. I had woken up that day at 7:30 to get my new license, and I ended up taking a nap on one of the comfy couches in the lobby of the studio. Things really started to come together once we let go of the idea of separation, and we started to listen to each other in a clump rather than scattered across the room. Who knew that natural blending would beat artificial? Some of the group members think of our records as methods of archiving our work, but I’m certain that this will turn out to be something more. Need to produce way less discs this time around – turns out the demand isn’t quite as strong as we’d thought it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minute the semester is over though, I’m going to start from scratch. I started the space record, and about 3 songs into it, school hit hard. Then I started the still life record, thinking that boshing around trying to find unfamiliar tones would lead to a successful recording. I was too afraid to write anything else, even though my collaboration with Amanda sounded pretty cool. I like that – it’s not anything brand new, the idea of collaborating with an artist who expresses themself through a different medium, but it’s an idea that isn’t take advantage of very often. Ed had recommended a really cool photoblog, pictures of Durham Township, Pennsylvania. I’ve realized that I want to collaborate with people I know though. Anyway, so that idea is still collecting dust, as is my synth and all the software I’ve stolen. Think I’ll get back to the heart of things, and start writing about my life again. That’s how it started out, this whole songwriting thing, and then I moved into love, and then into fictional stories. Scott mentioned that concept albums are a good vehicle for me, and I agree, but I guess I always feel left out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fantastic week element number one: three fantastic albums leaked. Paul Simon’s Surprise was really a surprise. Eno co-writes and produces, along with Hancock and Frissell. Very cool stuff. I also bought the new Glen Phillips off of emusic (subscription site that Sami recommended. If you download the 40 songs a month, it works out to .25 per song, not to mention they don’t come in propietary format). Some cool songs, and some old ones re-done. Sounds like stuff he wants to hear/release. The new Teitur album has thrilled me so much, I’ve sent it to a few people who all have different favorite songs. Martita and I were talking about how complex the music is, moreso than Poetry and Airplanes (more accessible). There’s a lot of depth here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had elections in the studio and I’m to be the president of OASN next semester. Feels like getting hired as the “new James Bond” or something, and it takes getting used to. Once again, we get a facelift. Always bigger and better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve completed two of my hardest finals, but this weekend will still be consumed with writing a final, writing a paper, studying for my other two finals, and starting to think about summer. If I can swing it, I’ll be developing some cool systems for housing and dining, while working a 9-5 job at Weichert, occasionally helping out at Mehmood cha cha’s financial planning firm. I’m a bit nervous to travel to Europe, I don’t know why. The thought of seeing Liza though, balances that nervousness with pure excitement. It’s amazing to think that after this summer, we get to live in the same city again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan for tommorow: meet with Dime/Treble, chat about the future. Write a paper on Arrow electronics, write my e-commerce final. Start thinking about Marketing and Operations finals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone told me that there’s a chemical in your brain which makes time seem slower, and that it decreases as you get older. Summer vacations in elementary school felt like years, and rainstorms were everyday. I’m almost a senior in college now, and nothing is slowing down. Still though, looking back – it’s the exact number of hours and minutes. Someone else mentioned that it probably slows down again when you reach a certain age. I want a drug that does that now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Birthday</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My birthday was memorable. OASN took a trip to Drexel to sing with their groups, and we stopped at cracker barrel on the way. Maybe 60% of joy during roadtrips come from rest stops. In the same way that women have their menstrual cycle at the time when they live together, male a capella groups crave the exact same type of food at the exact same moment. Generally that means Wendy&amp;rsquo;s or Steak n Egg. But there&amp;rsquo;s nothing like hearing &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what I was thinking.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
The after party was at a small and sneaky house, with floors upon floors. Maybe it was the alcohol, but it seemed as if there were infinite floors in this house. We stayed in a small townhouse near &amp;ldquo;Rape Park&amp;rdquo; (where people get stabbed). I came back to the townhouse a bit early and somehow I was good to go by noon the next day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The parents had a surprise party for me, and had invited the entire group, other AU friends, and a stripper named Aisha/Tara. I had no idea what to do. But Ben and I licked whipped cream off of her nipple, and she put a push pop in her vagina.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maybe everything is alright. Maybe what I percieve other people to percieve me as is irrelevant. I was considering what I would write in a letter to be opened after my death. That sounds morbid, and somewhat emo, but nonetheless I was thinking about what I&amp;rsquo;d write. One of those things you think about but you don&amp;rsquo;t talk about over lunch. My final decision is not to have a letter. Does that make sense? I&amp;rsquo;m never hesitant to publish some thoughts to a website during my lifetime, but I think when I die, if it&amp;rsquo;s mysterious, then I want to maintain some of that mystery forever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that this summer I want to build a robot. I want to save up, buy the parts, assemble the robot, and then write scripts to make the robot do things. In 8th grade, Sam and I wrote a program that made a robotic arm move blocks from one side of the desk to the other. Then, Whitney built a laser and no one cared about our robot anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike arranged Out of the Woods for OASN to perform, and I swear that was probably the best moment of my week. I had forgotten how good that song is. Amazing how young that group is, or was when they recorded their debut. It brought me back to the summer when a few friends and I went to see Nickel Creek perform at the Kennedy Center on a long and winding adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had stopped watching the progress of my hand and fingers and all of a sudden I realized that they&amp;rsquo;re almost back to full strength. The thumb and pointer are still a little droopy, but I can finger pick again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to finish watching the Godfather tonight. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those movies that every guy I know has memorized, and I figured it&amp;rsquo;s about time I grow up. The first step, learning to enjoy football, was easy. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty fluent now, and my reason for wanting the Steelers to win the superbowl is not because they&amp;rsquo;re good (that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; a reason to like a team), but it&amp;rsquo;s because the Seahawks beat the Redskins. So they should lose the superbowl. Does that make sense?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to stay friends. I believe people live their lives by living things that have already happened to them. Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s why things pass us by so quickly. So you&amp;rsquo;re in this ride with a few people, and then it becomes your way of living as you move on to new rides that will become your way of living in the future. This may explain the emptiness I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to conquer. Perhaps all I needed was people who were there for that ride.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I ordered squid tonight. The sushi place we went to is one that we&amp;rsquo;ve been to before. The place where awkward tension was strung out like sweaters on a clothesline, where Liza tried her best to order something I would enjoy as much as her, and teetering between whether or not I was lying when I said that I like Bento Boxes. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t. This time around was almost uneventful, but in a way I preferred it. We heard about London and we talked about characters from old volumes. The outing was spontaneous, different, it was what I expected and I loved every second of it. That is why I ordered squid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t deep. My aim is to get away from deep because it gets too complicated. My goal is get to the surface as quickly and calmly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was into discovering a new record on amazon and being taken by the rave reviews, which I understand now are mostly long-time fans or record label or management people, and downloading it on napster or Audiogalaxy. Finding some sort of gem of a song, and playing it through my Harmon-Kardon speakers, no subwoofer, and the window was open. Sometimes home seems really far away. But maybe that&amp;rsquo;s what I will be saying about 213 one day. In the same way, I miss Letts 5 North.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that I would like to live in the country after this. Foreign country, or this country, just somewhere rural. Someone told me today that my record got them through hard times. I&amp;rsquo;ve wished for that. Never expected, just wished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hardly used to watch TV, but ever since I&amp;rsquo;ve started using torrents I&amp;rsquo;ve had the chance to watch some great shows. Prison Break, Weeds, 24, My Name is Earl, Book of Daniel (got cancelled tonight).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it about DC that makes it lonely and lively depending on the flavor that week? The tapioca pearls give the bubble tea flavor, and I had some without the pearls the other day, I wanted my money back. That&amp;rsquo;s it – that&amp;rsquo;s why the sleepless nights. Once the novelty of the city wears off, all you have left are those pearls, until you can&amp;rsquo;t find them anymore and you&amp;rsquo;re stuck with some odd tasting milky substance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to try something brand new. I&amp;rsquo;ve been going to bed the past few nights unfulfilled and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why. Even after lots of thought, I can&amp;rsquo;t put my finger on it. I have a few ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brain hasn&amp;rsquo;t done any substantial work in a long time. I need a Rubix cube probably. Something to work on physically as I&amp;rsquo;m emotionally sorting stuff out. I bought a puzzle when I was 7 which had four pieces, and no matter how hard I tried they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t fit. Every combination led to a dead end. Turns out it was one of those one-fell-swoop moves, with two halves (two connected pieces) swinging into each other and clicking into place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the type of revelation I&amp;rsquo;m hoping for. Everytime I try to write a song, I&amp;rsquo;m blind. And everytime I finish a song I enjoyed writing, I&amp;rsquo;ve remembered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our staff meeting yesterday, Rosie asked us to draw a house as a metaphor for our being, and then label the foundation, windows, walls, roof, and chimney with words that describe certain qualities of ourselves. We all agreed that it was interesting, even though it was just a simple self-reflection excersise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My foundation is one-ness. Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading books about networks, emergence theory, and the idea that everyone and everything is held together by eternal and universal thread. The idea that we all need each other. Comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s winter. I live behind an ampitheater, near a stream which never flows unless it rains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to add that I will be posting songs here that I think are enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why do people get offended when you give em compliments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok so it&amp;rsquo;s maybe it&amp;rsquo;s not really offense they&amp;rsquo;re taking. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about that kinda awkward stare they give you, and then after a quick &amp;ldquo;thank you&amp;rdquo; they run and tell all their friends about how weird you are. And then they begin to think you have something for em or something. There are so many people, and I wanna tell them how great I think they are. I&amp;rsquo;m like that. But the thing is most of them I don&amp;rsquo;t know very well. They&amp;rsquo;d think I was being stupid. Or coming onto them or something.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But the thing is most of them I don&amp;rsquo;t know very well. They&amp;rsquo;d think I was being stupid. Or coming onto them or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so why tell them? well, because… I dunno. Partly I want them to feel what I&amp;rsquo;m feeling. I mean there are tons of people this can apply to. People who are on stage, people are who are just in daily life being great people. Cuz we&amp;rsquo;re running outta good people quickly. It&amp;rsquo;s cool when someone is cool. Does that make sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked home alone today. I usually get a ride home from school with jess, but today she had auditions, jon had something to do…. i took the bus. My sister was with a friend, so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t chat with her. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s just that I hate being bored. I can&amp;rsquo;t understand why this feeling is there, it&amp;rsquo;s so strange. It&amp;rsquo;s kinda like I&amp;rsquo;m looking for something new, but that new is something that&amp;rsquo;s buried in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep getting these flashbacks of Egypt, and actually back even farther. It kinda soothes me. Megaman, that&amp;rsquo;s where it&amp;rsquo;s at. I used to play that all the time in elementary school. I dunno why I like it so much. The colors of an 8-bit nintendo system is aweosme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just want all this shit to end. Cuz once it does, once exams are all over, it&amp;rsquo;s a 5 day weekend for me. So great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll write more about all this later. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably just add to this entry. English calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D: What&#39;s wrong?&lt;br&gt;
Z: No one is picking up!&lt;br&gt;
D: Can you phone room 531 or 529 to tell room 530 that is pizza is here?&lt;br&gt;
Z: I think she hung up on me. I&#39;m not sure what to do.&lt;br&gt;
D: …some rooms have parties with beers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;li&gt;Reply with your name and I will write something about you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will then tell you what song reminds me of you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, I will tell you who you remind me of, celebrity, animated or otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last, I will try to name a single word that best describes you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put this in your journal.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today marked a very joyous day in history. OASN went from inviting new members by email to an actual intiation, Chambers style. Ed, Scott, Ace and I got together for a few hours yesterday to figure something worthy out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan went down this morning. Ed and I sneak into Leonard at approximately 2:57 am. New OASN member Dominic is partying in a room on our floor. We capture him and blindfold him with Liza&#39;s handkerchief.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The plan went down this morning. Ed and I sneak into Leonard at approximately 2:57 am. New OASN member Dominic is partying in a room on our floor. We capture him and blindfold him with Liza&#39;s handkerchief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At approximately the same time on the other side, of campus, Ace and Scott capture new OASN member TJ, after finding a replacement for him at his job (the same job that I have). At approximately 3:03, all of us meet up at Scott&#39;s car in the tunnel. The new members are told not to speak and to get in the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drive to a secret location and both victims put their hands on glass and repeat the OASN oath, passed down through many generations of singers (we wrote it last night). After they verbally admit that they are “but notes on an empty staff, and will soon join the harmonius powerchord that is On a Sensual Note” the blindfolds are removed and we&#39;re at Steak n Egg. Breakfast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After breakfast, I sleep for an hour and go to work, where I am now. I&#39;ve skimmed through the poetry reading for today&#39;s class at 12:45 and it&#39;s all random bullshit. I got my first assignment back in African American Lit, and I did horribly. I got the lowest grade in the class (other people got the same grade, but I was still in that category). And his notes said that I summarized too much instead of analyzing. I always told myself I&#39;d never be one of those people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyway, I&#39;m pretty disappointed in myself. All this means though is I have to stay motivated and do better next time. Can&#39;t be that hard, right? I guess it&#39;s just the standard wake up call that I tend to get around the third of week of class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another note, I&#39;m loving this job. I feel like I&#39;m in high school again, but eh. I&#39;m sure that I will get used to it. This time of day is perfect too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve decided that people who are horrible don&#39;t deserve attention. Sounds logical, but unfortunately they end up getting it the most. No one in particular, but I think this is just going to be my policy from now on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So luckily, Bryan didn&#39;t start the permanent schedule till Tuesday. But my week looks like this:&lt;br&gt;
Monday, I wake up at 5:30 am for a two hour shift. Class at 11:20, Lab at 12:45-3:25. Practice at 10-12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, I wake up at 8:15 for three classes, done by 12:35 and then I can do whatever the fuck I want. Tuesday will be my awesome day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday, I wake up at 5:30 again for a 2 hour shift. Class at 12:45-3:25. Not too shabby, gives me about 4 hours of sleep if I want it. Practice at 10-12.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Thursday, I wake up at 7:30 for a 2 hour shift. Class at 11:20. Another shift at 1:30-5:30. Thursday will be my painful day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday, I wake up at 8:15 for my three classes in a row till 12:35. But then I&#39;m done. It&#39;s funny, I never thought the days where I had 8:30&#39;s and three classes in a row would be my awesome days that I am probably gonna be looking forward too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last few semesters I&#39;ve been able to wake up lateish, like around 10 most days, some later. This semester, all my shit happens in the morning. I&#39;m basically going the Chris Barrick route. Let&#39;s see how it turns out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This semester is sort of taunting me. Normally I can sit in my classes and after the first week, have an idea of how horrible it&#39;s going to be. With this current semester, I have absolutely no clue. I&#39;m sure that will change soon, but who knows. What&#39;s nice is that I won&#39;t have work for another couple of days. I wouldn&#39;t say this job is stressful, but it&#39;s high tension. Like… something &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; go wrong, but I&#39;ve had good luck.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I wouldn&#39;t say this job is stressful, but it&#39;s high tension. Like… something &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; go wrong, but I&#39;ve had good luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;ve moved even farther away from the pretty desktop features, and moved to a windows manager that&#39;s entirely keyboard activated. I hardly touch the mouse anymore, because my mp3 player and AIM are all keyboard activated too. It&#39;s really awesome, every window takes up the full screen, but I can set it up so that it goes into a split screen mode. The writer musta really hated his mouse because it&#39;s called ratpoison. As in, killing the rodent. I originally thought I&#39;d end up hating it, but it&#39;s lightning fast and really efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bsflite in top window, mocp in lower.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;logjam in top window, firefox in lower.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played poker with the guys and lost horribly. But I was never a competitive guy. It doesn&#39;t really matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edited cause i fixed the pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I like this. So far I&#39;ve had really early shifts, I haven&#39;t taken any naps, I get up at pretty reasonable times without moaning too much, and I spend full days out and about being active. As much fun as lazing around is, when I get into that habit it really fucks up my life. So thankfully, I&#39;m not letting that happen this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this semester will work perfectly for me. But I also think that when summer gets nearby, I will be ready and willing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m at my new job right now. And I have to say I really love it. I only have to work 2 hours at a time, and I can work at whatever time of the day I want, provided that no one else takes that space before, provided I get a number that works that way, when we draw out of a hat, in a random bingo game that lasts for 2 hours and usually results in a few people working crazy overtime.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;But I guess that&#39;s how life works out. Anyway, I sit here behind a desk, get asked questions, phone calls are made, IDs are checked, and I just sit here and type away on my laptop. I need to take more early morning/late night shifts. Just as long as it isn&#39;t like… 3:30-5:30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But other than that, school has been actually really invigorating. My classes kick a lot of ass. Here&#39;s a little rundown with z. (That was the best joke I&#39;ve ever made, and if you missed it, I&#39;m sorry.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physics: My professor is absolutely nuts. I mean absolutely. We walked in and she was playing “American Pie.” Which is fine, I like that song. She said “It&#39;s funny, I&#39;m dating myself. I mean… not like, having sex with myself. I mean, this song is older than myself. HA nevermind.” Seems like she really cares about teaching, went on and on about how other schools wish they had AU&#39;s gen ed program. And I actually realized if it wasn&#39;t for the Gen Ed program I&#39;d probably still be taking shitty audio tech classes for the major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managerial Accounting: Honest to God, this class seems really interesting. We spent the class talking about the differences between financial and managerial accounting. It seems like managerial is just a lot less formal, and the accounts are a lot more broad. Which works for me, since Financial was so goddamn specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;African American Lit: My professor fucking rocks. We talked about the moral responsibility that blacks supposedely have when they&#39;re writing. And how indentity will show it&#39;s face no matter what. “And perhaps blacks will want to write like Tennyson. Write like Tennyson! Write like John Coltrane!” I have a feeling that this will be favorite lit class yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience of Poetry: I&#39;ve got this in a couple of hours. Apparently the teacher is a huge bitch… we&#39;ll see how this goes. I&#39;m good with bitchy teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound Synth II: Yeah I don&#39;t know how this is going to pan out. The projects look kind of cool actually… we&#39;re doing one with Csound (writing C code and compiling it in soundform.) But, the class started 15 minutes late, ended 40 minutes early, and we went around and played the name game with diseases (I&#39;m Dan and I have down syndrome)… even though we all know each other from last semester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came across that speak in truth journal or whatever. I mean, obviously as everyone&#39;s pointed out, the person who posted has no soul. But come on – it was obvious they wanted a bitchfight on the net through the comments and everyone gave it to them. If no one commented, no one woulda cared, and Ms. Speak in truth would have been extremely sad-faced… 🙁&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I heard something about Wootton cheerleaders being in porn or something. Man, I&#39;m really glad I don&#39;t live in North Potomac anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tons of things, man. It&#39;s been beautiful. I&#39;ve been working on linux, writing my album, listening to lots and lots of music, seeing great people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New years was sort of a drag. No one&#39;s fault – it&#39;s just the holiday. It&#39;s getting to be so mundane. But maybe that&#39;s cause I wasn&#39;t home for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in 1st period right now and Jon is making clicking noises. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how long he can make them before I hit him in the head with this keyboard. Tony is insulting my livejournalism… I called him a cock. He took it well, and then I took it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That made no sense. I feel fine about writing a livejournal in school! Seriously, fine. Dave&amp;rsquo;s doing it, Elyssa&amp;rsquo;s checking some. This is not an addiction. It&amp;rsquo;s just some fun stuff to do while we&amp;rsquo;re bored.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Apparently I have to get a sheet signed by all my teachers if I&amp;rsquo;m going to do a college visit. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to do this when I&amp;rsquo;m sick. Can&amp;rsquo;t I just go to the college visit and then send a note saying I was sick? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that just be easier?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that my pneumonia is gone. I&amp;rsquo;m coughing a little more now, but I&amp;rsquo;m not short of breath every 2 seconds. Turns out all I needed was some sleep and some tea. This feels really awkward, writing a journal entry in the library, with people walking by observing, with Jon Gerst sitting next to me writing a paper. Jon thinks that people who write in LiveJournals do it to spark contraversy. He didn&amp;rsquo;t mean it in a negative way though. I can&amp;rsquo;t say that I don&amp;rsquo;t agree sometimes, but then there are those of us who just need to write to balance out their head. Like me. I remember when I took creative writing, we had to keep a journal and I could never do it. My journal entries just blew, and the funny thing is it&amp;rsquo;s because I knew that Ms. Jones would be reading it. And now there are like a million people reading my journal, and it makes me write more well. More… better. Whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think if no one read this I&amp;rsquo;d still write as much. I used to think that LiveJournaling sucked since I coudln&amp;rsquo;t go into anything really personal. Then I realized I guess that isn&amp;rsquo;t the point of a &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt; journal. The point is to communicate with a community I guess. That make sense? Communicate with a community?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;m definetely growing into this thing though. I even created a friends list, and this whole posting in school thing? Yeah that&amp;rsquo;s definetely a factor in the LiveJournal addiction equation. I&amp;rsquo;m nervous right now that some teacher is gonna come up to me and point to the sign on this computer that says &amp;ldquo;FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well the reason I&amp;rsquo;m out here in the library, by the way, is because there&amp;rsquo;s no announcements today. And of course, Jacobs isn&amp;rsquo;t here. Hell, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t freaking come to school either if there was no reason to come that early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon just brought up a good point. The stupid not-senior drama, will be &lt;em&gt;over&lt;/em&gt; in about 1.5 months. Jon&amp;rsquo;s so excited he just made my palm red with his high five. Ooh, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the senior drama will be over. On to bigger and better drama. I hope the drama in college is actually worth participating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony is doing a worksheet on moles. It&amp;rsquo;s killing me even thinking about last year&amp;rsquo;s chem extravanganza. Ugh, the bell just rang. Gotta find Ms. Towers and get my college slip signed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you lie in your bed, and keep really quiet, and your&amp;rsquo;e halfway between sleep and awake, and you listen really intently while being in this state, you can hear the circuitry hum through your wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah I actually did that today. It was really cool. And I started getting nostalgic for some reason. Actually I have been getting nostalgic all day. Thinkin about Egypt and everything. Thinking about Egypt is like my comfort zone, cuz I&amp;rsquo;m always happy when I&amp;rsquo;m in that mindset. Makes all of the shit problems of today seem kind of insignificant for a while.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Makes all of the shit problems of today seem kind of insignificant for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m not a huge Tori Amos fan or anything, but I have tons of respect for an artist who can make a record of 18 full length songs, and have it get great reviews and such. So anyway, I picked up her new record from the library, where I get all the new pop records, and I have to say I&amp;rsquo;m very impressed. The single on the radio, when in context with the album, is such an amazing song. The album is sort of a concept album, about a chick who travels across the country, embarking on all sorts of adventures. I love it and totally recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some guy from WJ made a post about how we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t judge their cast/drama club on a couple of idiots. I&amp;rsquo;m in agreement. We were prone to get caught up in our feelings of anger, but now it&amp;rsquo;s time to realize that there are people who are actually decent, who respect the work we&amp;rsquo;ve put in to the show. Even if that guy thinks our show blows… I still have mad respect for him for being mature… as we should&amp;rsquo;ve been in the first place before declaring war. I was definetely part of that anger though. Just the way I feel. Sarah and I are planning to discuss the matter of respect towards WJ tommorow at the meeting. I think the club is mature enough to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom found a vial of cocaine in the backyard. Now she thinks I&amp;rsquo;m a coke addict. I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I&amp;rsquo;m leaving next year. Well sort of. My dad&amp;rsquo;s thinking of taking a business trip overseas, meaning that he&amp;rsquo;d only be at home 2 weeks for every month for an entire year. This means bad stuff for my mom… emotional strain and whatnot. I&amp;rsquo;m kinda lucky in a way, I don&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with it, since I&amp;rsquo;ll be at school anyway. Most parents would make their kids work off their school finances. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the culture, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, my parents are determined to have minimal debt when my sister and I graduate from college. I can&amp;rsquo;t be more thankful. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I show it enough. In fact I think I run against it. I think I prove to the more and more everday why they &lt;em&gt;shouldn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; be helping me out with the money. I have a good life, I can&amp;rsquo;t forget that. Grant and I agreed – I must get straight A&amp;rsquo;s in college or I&amp;rsquo;m just fucking everybody that has helped me thus far over. In a more coherent sentence, to make use of the massive amounts of moola being spent on my education, I must get good grades. Good grades = scholarships. Scholarships = happy parents. Happy parents = proud parents. Proud parents = happy kid. See, A really does equal E.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a 3 hour nap today, and had the craziest ass dream ever. It was whacked out. A bunch of us were hanging out at my house. Sarah was trying to escape from a rabid lamb (don&amp;rsquo;t ask) and she shut the garage door on it&amp;rsquo;s head. Then, and then… oh god… we started dancing to The Jackson 5&amp;rsquo;s I Want You Back. Zach Goldbaum was the Michael Jackson. Why? Becuase there are no laws in dreams! Anything goes. And although I&amp;rsquo;m not a great romancer I know that you&amp;rsquo;re …. I&amp;rsquo;ll stop. Sarah thinks she killed the lamb, which represents Jesus. Sarah thinks she killed Jesus because she is Jewish. Could it be that my dreams have actual meaning? That represent something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Miracles tonight 🙁 Booo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online chatting today wasn&amp;rsquo;t very fun, you guys. Nobody was online. Everyone was offline or away. Booo. Oh and here&amp;rsquo;s another booo. Relland might be coming back tommorow. If he does that will ruin my entire life. Or… the next month and a half of school that I have left before I get the fuck out of Wootton. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I love Wootton. But it&amp;rsquo;s really about time to get the fuck out. Anyway, having Ms. Ingram teach the class made me actually wanna stay in the class and learn. This one of things that parents say … that teachers are not responsible for the effort you pur forth in their class, and if you get a poor grade, it&amp;rsquo;s not the teacher. Well I&amp;rsquo;ve got news for you people that think that, IT IS the teacher. At least in high school anyway. I haven&amp;rsquo;t done a shred of work in Psych, and I got an A for 3rd quarter. Now Theory, that&amp;rsquo;s a whole different ballgame. I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; haven&amp;rsquo;t done shit in that class. Good lord have I not done shit. Got a C somehow. Basically, I think he kinda looks through the grades and just kinda says &amp;ldquo;well this person is … um… alright B.&amp;rdquo; He knows I didn&amp;rsquo;t do shit. C was the lowest I could get. Well, I&amp;rsquo;m not freaking complaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, another negative point of my day. No new strongbad email. I look forward to these things every week and fucking the Brothers chap have left me the fuck down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever happened to getting Icy Cream on weekdays? We need to do that again, Jon. I wonder if sleeping for 3 hours has made me less tired now when it comes time to actually go to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow those two thoughts were not inter related at all! Wowwww. And I also have to say that Juno really sucks. The internet service. Yeah, the free one with the banner ads. It is fucked up, it installs spyware on your comp, so that right now millions of companies everywhere know what I&amp;rsquo;m typing in my livejournal. Not like it&amp;rsquo;s a very private matter anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like getting coffee tommorow but it&amp;rsquo;s too late to call Christine to alert her to be ready early. This is the problem with driving people to school, you can&amp;rsquo;t really decide to skip or get sick at the last minute because you have a responsibility. The up side is you get to see a pretty face in the rear view everyday :-).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since it&amp;rsquo;s almost midnight I&amp;rsquo;m gonna turn in. Turn into what you ask? A werewolf? Count Dracula?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life&amp;rsquo;s good, I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying it. PJ described this last semester as sort of being a ghost. Floating around the school randomly and not really putting forth effort into anything really. I&amp;rsquo;m down with relaxation. Today has been &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; eventful. Good lord. I need to go to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy 6th period lunch. I look forward to it everyday. Funny people, good times. Andy was on drugs today, that was funny. And we talked about those random kids always rapping in the halls and how Chris aspires to be one. We talked a little about college too. Billy&amp;rsquo;s undecided between Indiana and Cincy, but he&amp;rsquo;ll probably go to Cincy in my opinion. Chris will probably go to Indiana… and now that I think about it, that might influence Billy. But who knows… I kinda wish I could could go to college with these guys. But what can ya do. Indiana&amp;rsquo;s recording program only takes 5 people per year. Who&amp;rsquo;s to say I&amp;rsquo;d be one of those 5?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, now I really need to go to sleep. It&amp;rsquo;s so late! Did I leave anything out about my day? I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. American University overnight in 2 days. Looking forward to sleeping in that day. Thing starts at 1, no way in hell am I going to school. And then, &lt;strong&gt;SPRING BREAK!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my dad used to say, it&amp;rsquo;s beddy bye time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve only eaten one thing today and that is an IHOP burger. By today, I actually mean yesterday since it&amp;rsquo;s actually April 6 now. It&amp;rsquo;s about 1 in the morning and I just got back from the Martin Sexton show. This was hands down, the best concert I&amp;rsquo;ve ever been to. John Mayer, Toad, even Vaco… Martin made them all look talentless with a simple guitar and the sweetest voice you&amp;rsquo;ll ever hear. That is a bold statement, since I&amp;rsquo;ve seen vaco 7 times and I&amp;rsquo;ve been a Toad fan since 1990. My expectations for what a good concert is have been raised.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I mean honestly. Some of the notes he hit were just unbelievable, I&amp;rsquo;ve never heard notes like that. Andy &amp;amp; Billy woulda been so impressed. Christine really enjoyed it too it seemed – there were times where she just coudln&amp;rsquo;t wipe the grin off her face – and rightfully so! At one point, there was a taper in the audience… front row, with a microphone and minidisk. Martin started singing into the guys mic cuz he was so close. Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to hear how that came out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got all my Ziggy Marley stuff. I&amp;rsquo;m doing a promotional thing for him and getting paid, which is great. Not a whole lot, but definetely something significant to my wallet. His album is really decent, and I&amp;rsquo;m not even a big reggae fan or anything. It comes out April 15, but they sent me about 7 advance copies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ugh, I smell like smoke. Stupid 9:30 club always makin me smell like smoke. I got a recording gig tommorow with Stephen Bragale. I haven&amp;rsquo;t touched my mixer in like months, so it&amp;rsquo;ll be nice to get back into the swing of things. And I need to start puttin together more of my own music. Writing more. I need to make an actual record. I put a bunch of songs together and called it an album… but truly it&amp;rsquo;s not an album. I&amp;rsquo;m proud of maybe 3-5 songs on it… and I think once I make a cd of 10-15 songs that I&amp;rsquo;m proud of, I can call that an album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then what? Would I sell it? That would be an investment, and I think that the people who would buy it would mainly be friends, since I don&amp;rsquo;t actually play anywhere yet. Maybe next year, who knows, I could score some gigs at American. And if not, I&amp;rsquo;ll keep being a recording artist. Making music in the most creative way possible. I really am a one-man sorta guy. Not in a self gratifying sorta way or anything. I mean… and let me get a diet vanilla coke before I explain…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like a creation, where I am in complete artistic control. The thing that sucks about this, is that I can&amp;rsquo;t play my own drums, I can&amp;rsquo;t play bass, and I can&amp;rsquo;t be my own band without things falling apart. So, I make it up for it in creativity. The problem now is getting that level of creativity to the point at which it adds to the creation without seeming out of place or &amp;ldquo;just there.&amp;rdquo; Is this making sense? It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. The fact is, I never want a straight up band. I have nothing against the idea. I just think if I were to ever make a record, it&amp;rsquo;d have to be something different. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be like radiohead or something. I just want me to come across. Sometimes in recodings that I do, it happens. I hear me in them, that&amp;rsquo;s when I&amp;rsquo;m proud, that&amp;rsquo;s when I&amp;rsquo;m happy with them. When I hear a slight echo of my influences. &lt;em&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; when I&amp;rsquo;m happy. Even if the song was good, but it was so obvious that it didn&amp;rsquo;t come from my own emotion, I woudln&amp;rsquo;t be satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still… and then what? If I&amp;rsquo;m really gonna go anywhere, I need to make a name for myself. And right now, I don&amp;rsquo;t care about that. All I care about is stacking another demo in a stack of demos, so that when I actually work, and actually have talent one day, and I can come back to the stack and be like &amp;ldquo;here&amp;rsquo;s something that had potential… let me potentialize it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m in no hurry. Let life slap me in the face, give me a bath, massage me… whatever. I try to let it come day by day. It&amp;rsquo;s a rhythm that I fuck up so much. 1 am is a fantastic time to write in a journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the metro on the way home, I overheard a guy say:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;He let the Jamaican cab driver come up to his room and played him a song. Can you believe that? I definetely would never let a Jamaican cab driver in my house, and I &lt;em&gt;definetely&lt;/em&gt; would not serenade him!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to figure out the back-story to this is just not even sensible. My brain hurts anyway. I&amp;rsquo;ve stopped listening to music late at night. I need to start doing that again. Gettin&amp;rsquo; back into Duncan now… I mean he&amp;rsquo;s always there but I&amp;rsquo;m just listening to him more now. I learn something new every time I hear one of these tunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I broke a red light yesterday, I think. I was over the stop line when it turned yellow and I might&amp;rsquo;ve gotten a ticket. There&amp;rsquo;s definetely a camera… it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of whether or not it took the photo. I didn&amp;rsquo;t see a flash or anything. Please please please no ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s funny how one hour gets tossed out of a day and everything gets out of whack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was a really nice sunday. I woke up late, round 11:30 I think. My mom had made pancakes, so I sat near an open window wndow and chilled and ate my pancakes. After that I chilled in my bed a little bit and just let the day roll on. Read a little bit of Les Mis (which rules by the way) and some of Zen and the Art… one of those so called intellectual books that everyone is supposed to read. It&amp;rsquo;s been described to me as &amp;ldquo;boring at some points, but the best book i&amp;rsquo;ve ever read.&amp;rdquo; Well darn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some kid from WJ wrote a review on Les Mis and gave me an F, which is worse than anyone else got. I was about to get all offended and then I found he&amp;rsquo;s playing the pimp! That just made the whole thing seem amusing rather than offensive. Also cuz I can&amp;rsquo;t picture anyone else besides Mitch in that part. Haha, scramble bitches. He said I was like Dr. Strangelove. I really want to go to the show in a wheelchair and talk to him in a german accent about how well he did playing le peemp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well right now it&amp;rsquo;s 11:14 and the reason I still haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten tired/gone to bed yet is because it&amp;rsquo;s daylight savings and my body clock is thrown off. It&amp;rsquo;s ok because I mean, I&amp;rsquo;ll be wakin up an hour later than… oh shit… goddamn fucking science. I&amp;rsquo;m waking up an hour earlier. Why&amp;rsquo;d I have to think about it? Now, the psychologicalness will take over and I&amp;rsquo;ll feel really tired tommorow and probably be hardcore napping by the time I come home. Mmm… nap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve came over to record today. Very happy with how it went. He was quick and didn&amp;rsquo;t reallly require more than one take to get the tracking done. Not to say more than one take is a bad thing 😉 You should see me mixing my music. I&amp;rsquo;m reading more about the art of mixing and realizing some interesting shit. If I give every instrument a different frequency, the mix will sound a lot more balanced. This kinda shit is supposed to be obvious to me. Why am I so dumb??? But yeah anyway, we did about 4 tracks, and they&amp;rsquo;re probably the best acoustic tracks I&amp;rsquo;ve produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of recording… I came up with the songs I&amp;rsquo;m planning to record in the next few weeks. List is for my reference. Let&amp;rsquo;s see… mutual thing, orchestral mood, maybe pneumonia… thinking of trying a slower version of it or something. Maybe even genius… like a brand new recording. And mixing till it sounds good as shit and then making a good cd or something. I think writing over the high school period has prepared me and let me know when I write a good song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it supposed to be cold tonight? I am so warm in my room. Simpsons was hilarious tonight. Can&amp;rsquo;t believe I only discovered that show like a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, 3 more days of school, then AU overnight, and then spring break baby!!!! YEAH!!!!! So what the fuck&amp;rsquo;s up with this school day at the end of spring break. That ain&amp;rsquo;t happening. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to school, and neither is the school, and pretty much all of the teachers aren&amp;rsquo;t either. We&amp;rsquo;re caught up, come on MCPS. I mean we probably aren&amp;rsquo;t, but who gives a shit, I&amp;rsquo;m graduating right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m scared for this AU sleepover thing. But Lauren will be there, so at least I&amp;rsquo;ll have someone to talk to. Or maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll meet some cool people that&amp;rsquo;ll be my friends next year. Orrrr, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll come home every weekend. What will be my fate? Tune in next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bed, here I come.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Napping is my new found secret talent. I came home afterschool yesterday and just passed out. It was probably due to the fact that I was out at the concert the night before, but the fact is I was still passed the fuck out. Still addicted to gum. Good lord. Been chewing this shit forever now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the nap I watched a movie with Christine and that was fun. Well the movie was ok… being with Christine was awesome. And after that I headed over to Mariam’s… Billy Jon and I slept over. They had just finished watching Dumb and Dumber, which I’ve still never seen. We played Cranium with Mariam’s cousins and it was guys vs. girls. Who do you think won? 😉&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It’s alwys good to have Billy on your team. Competitive as shit, and boasts about never losing. The sweet thing is, I’ve never seen him lose! Especially last night. We were on fire. Here comes another piece of gum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fell asleep around 3, which is better than I thought I’d do, and I woke up and chatted with Laura on my cell phone while relaxing in bed. Portable AIM is deadly. In terms of ringing up a huge bill. Ha, ringing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woke up this morning and went to IHOP, and Jon insisted on nothing but IHOP. We got there and the place was PACKED. For some reason our party of 4 waited for like 10 mins but the entrance was JAM PACKED with people trying to get in to eat their waffles. 1 in the afternoon too. Unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a fun night, but I don’t feel like going into detail about it. I have napping to do. Sexton tonight! Can’t fucking wait.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; wait for college. I went to American tonight to see Matt Nathanson play. They have this thing stage set up in their cafeteria with a nice sound system and everything. Problem is the sound crew is &lt;em&gt;horrible&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m nervous because I&amp;rsquo;m going to school there for sound next year. I really hope they weren&amp;rsquo;t students in that program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show was really good, and Matt got so frustrated with the sound he ended up just unplugging his guitar and standing on an amp and playing kumbaya style. It was fun. I went with Jon, Tony, and Billy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Tommorow is Friday and I might skip school or something. Being a second semester (4th quarter) senior, and I can&amp;rsquo;t stress this enough, RULES. In a good mood tonight, gonna go to sleep happy. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll read a chapter outta Les Mis before I hit the sack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was most definetely a gorgeous day. School got over at like 11:40, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything in chambers really, so 5th and 6th period really dragged on. Nothing really important happened today in school. Yesterday I sang for the entire school, a song I wrote for the Every 15 Mins program. I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone really cared about the song, which is fine, I woudln&amp;rsquo;t have cared either if I was in the audience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Today after school I went to Checkers with a few friends and that was amaazingly fun. We took Linzy&amp;rsquo;s convertible and in 83 degree weather drove out into the big city of Gaithersburg. God, it was gorgeous. Blue skies and everyone in the car was happy and having a good time. PJ was making me laugh as usual. Havin&amp;rsquo; that guy around makes any situation better. I think if I ever were sentenced to the electric chair… nevermind this is a really bad example. Even if I were sentenced to the electric chair, not even the Poo Song could make me feel better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yeah, it was very satisfying. And then I came home and napped. I realized that that is what I&amp;rsquo;m going to be doing from now on. Coming back from school and just taking a long ass nap on my comfy bed with the fan on high. Blasting some sorta music. Today it happened to be Robbie Williams&amp;rsquo; new album. Can&amp;rsquo;t believe Best Buy sometimes… 5.99 for this record. So far it hasn&amp;rsquo;t really moved me, but it sounds like it has potential. As always it&amp;rsquo;s well produced. I love Guy Chambers, Robbie&amp;rsquo;s producer. He really knows how to make a good project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK here is my 3rd quarter report card!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TV – A&lt;br&gt;
Show Choir Intern – A&lt;br&gt;
Screenwriting – A&lt;br&gt;
AP Theory – C&lt;br&gt;
Chambers – A&lt;br&gt;
English – B&lt;br&gt;
Psych – B&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with this. Creative writing was an honors course, so I&amp;rsquo;m figuring screenwriting is an honors course too. And that means a weighted 4.14. I guess that&amp;rsquo;s not fair… since it&amp;rsquo;s an elective AND it&amp;rsquo;s so easy. And fun as shit too. Marks is a reallly funny guy. Two rules to remember about women, he says. Number one, they are all crazy. Agreed. Number two, they are all sisters. Like, they will fight and fight and bitch at each other, but the minute a guy disagrees it&amp;rsquo;s like &lt;em&gt;HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, the new strong bad email rules! Matt Chapman has been quite off lately. Thank God he&amp;rsquo;s back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit that I am running back and forth between writing in my journal and watching American Idol. Kimberly Locke is in the bottom 3 and I have no idea why. Josh Gracin should be. I mean, truly, if he wins the competition, he said he&amp;rsquo;s still gonna be a marine. So he can&amp;rsquo;t go on to be a pop star. I just don&amp;rsquo;t understand you, America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon was right. Josh is extremely lucky. Now, to find out who really gets booted…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, that was bullshit. No eliminations this week? Cuz of Corey Clark. Yeah that&amp;rsquo;s just… so FOX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to what I was talking about before. I don&amp;rsquo;t really even remember. I need to strum my guitar for a while…&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Strangely enough I&amp;rsquo;m in a bad mood. Mainly because I&amp;rsquo;m tired right now. Partly because I just finished watching some depressing TV drama called Miracles. It&amp;rsquo;s become an obsession, I watch it every time there is a new episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I ever got around to writing about closing night. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t cry. A few people did, and it&amp;rsquo;s understandable, but it&amp;rsquo;s taking a while for things to hit me that way nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Tonight will be my last Wootton show ever. As one would expect, I&amp;rsquo;m nervous, sad, and really excited about giving one more hurrah on the Woottton Stage. It&amp;rsquo;s been &lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt; a fun ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past two shows have been very long nights, with lots and lots of events. Thursday night someone from the cast fainted because I guess she was stressed, and was feelin&amp;rsquo; light headed. We sold out last night, and had almost 1000 people in the audience. We actually sold 994 tickets, but there were people in the audience who didn&amp;rsquo;t buy tickets (ushers, parents, etc.). So it was gorgeously amazing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Today the seniors make paper plate awards for the cast members. It will be quite interesting. I have to leave at 3 or so, so I really hope that 3.5 hours is enough time to make 60 paper plate awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m feeling really refreshed right now. Last night I had a revelation, and now I feel a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okie doke… time to rock this out one more time. Oh yeah, and haircut tommorow 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A semi eventful day in the life of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day at school was short. I think this is mainly due to the fact that Billy, Jon, PJ, and I left school around 4th period to go to McDonalds. A day well spent, because in the words of Billy… McDonald&amp;rsquo;s is the shit. We saw all the QO kids there on their open lunch break. Glad we had Billy with us, otherwise there&amp;rsquo;da been trouble brewin. Not really. But still, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to feel safe. Ah, being a senior. Nothin better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;After days and days of long rehearsals, it was nice to finally come home at 2. I was gonna go for a walk with Christine originally, but then it rained and she had work to do… and it was probably for the better, because I got some time to chill in my room and play soft music and strum my guitar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yuck. Just coughed and it burned. I&amp;rsquo;m really congested. This needs to end. I mean, we have a show tommorow night, and then I have to sing in front of the whole school on Tuesday. I&amp;rsquo;ll just take some sudafed and hope for the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where was I? Yeah, so I came home and was chillin out at my computer and then Mariam called me. Turns out she was on the beltway and the traffic was horrible, so she needed a place to chill so I had her over till dinner time. I guess she went to Jess&amp;rsquo; then but it was a nice afternoon. We didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything – just kinda sat around and talked, watched a little bit of the news and groaned at the TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to register for the Selective Service since I&amp;rsquo;m 18. I hate the fact that I am forced to sign up for this shit, and if I don&amp;rsquo;t I could be in jail for 5 years. I mean really, how much sense does that make? There are some who would argue… but my point is still valid. I also just emailed American back about this overnight thing they&amp;rsquo;re doing. I figure I should probably go and see what my Universtiy is like when you&amp;rsquo;re living there. Plus, I might meet someone I want to room with, it&amp;rsquo;s probably a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I found out I had to write an essay… and Schlaf helped me write it. Funny thing about him, is he knows exactly what he&amp;rsquo;s talking about, yet he never does the work himself! No shame in it though … as if I&amp;rsquo;ve turned in anything on time in the past 2 months. I think Ms. Jones was pleased that I actually had something in on time. Funny person that Ms. Jones. Movin to Cali right on the day of our AP exam. Well, good for her I say. Enjoy the sunshine Ms. J.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, there is a show tommorow night. I plan on playing Skip Bo with David until the very minute we have to go on. Cuz that game rules and I need to go crazy before the show. And what better to go crazy than with Skip Bo? I could truly be a salesman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a crappy-ass note, Saturday night they&amp;rsquo;re predicting T-Storms… meaning we might have an indoor apache. That is fucking ridiciolous on closing night of the show. If it were just a matter of costumes we could just take them off. But I guess getting everyone to take off their mic is gonna be a pain in the ass. So… indoor apache it is 🙁&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gone through an entire packet of gum on this entry. Ugh! I am a sick bastar&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;t&amp;rsquo;s that time in the process of getting sick where my nose is only slightly clogged, except when I wake up when it is fully clogged. Well we performed for the middle school today, and they were possibly the worst audience ever. Even worse than the 8th graders from the year before. Or the year before that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m noticing that I&amp;rsquo;m gaining some weight. I mention it to anyone and they laugh at me, but I know when I&amp;rsquo;m gaining weight and it&amp;rsquo;s definetely now. Well, after this weekend there will be some changes. New haircut, new running/walking excercise everyday, and new music. I need to start writing again now that I have a fucking awesome guitar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m kinda worried about Filesharing… kazaa and all that. I hope it doesn&amp;rsquo;t shut down cuz that would sure fuck my life up for real. And honestly, if Napster is going to open back up as a pay service, I&amp;rsquo;d definetely pay, if it got back to the status that it was at when it closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left school at like 2 today, which was really nice, came home and rested. I&amp;rsquo;m going back to school in a few minutes to get Christine so I can see her for a few minutes. I&amp;rsquo;m praying that once the show finishes there will be less annoyances and more good times. I wanna see the guys a lot more. PJ and I were discussing how when we all leave for college, our friendship is basically done. It&amp;rsquo;s not like we&amp;rsquo;re not gonna have a good time when we see each other during breaks… but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to stay connected when you&amp;rsquo;re away for so long. If he goes to MC and chills around these parts next year though, I&amp;rsquo;ll be seeing him a lot more which is really good. And Mariam might be at UMD, which&amp;rsquo;d REALLY be awesome. So funny that I met all these people while being in High School and now we&amp;rsquo;re all almost in college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just reading some more headlines and emails about war stuff. There was this one thing going around to protest the war… and some sent back a letter saying that protesters were wasting their time and that they should realize what the war is about, yada yada, etc. I still don&amp;rsquo;t have enough knowledge to go one way or the other, but I guess preventing another attack on the US is a good thing. Then, some people are saying that this whole thing might just help to spur attacks. Once again… I have no idea what to think. It&amp;rsquo;ll probably be that way until the end of the war. Unless it lasts until I go to college… probably just &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; at AU will help me get more politically oriented. Politically oriented? Is that correct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to leave now to go back to school and pick up my sister and Christine. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll write more tonight. Fuckin MIracles was cancelled again last night! I hope it isn&amp;rsquo;t cancelled forever… I freakin&amp;rsquo; love that show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Found out today that my aunt has cancer. It still sounds like make believe to me, and I can&amp;rsquo;t really process the thought of her actually having a disease like that. It&amp;rsquo;s cancer and also I think there&amp;rsquo;s something wrong with her lungs. It&amp;rsquo;s like 2 diseases in one. I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to be dramatic or anything but she&amp;rsquo;s seriously one of the only family members on my dad&amp;rsquo;s side that I actually like. The cancer has spread so it&amp;rsquo;s like, if they can&amp;rsquo;t treat it, they just have to wait. It&amp;rsquo;s a sad day for my dad, it&amp;rsquo;s not his sister, although I call her an aunt, it&amp;rsquo;s actually his cousin. She taught me how to play rummy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at this. There&amp;rsquo;s a war going on in Iraq, my aunt may be dying… yet it&amp;rsquo;s 75 degrees outside and there isn&amp;rsquo;t a cloud in the sky. Confusing really, the contrasting weather to the situations presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a lighter note, I really wanted to go chill out on my deck today, it was so nice. Instead, Christine and I spent the day indoors. But it was my fault.. my legs hurt and I suggested not going outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Went to McD&amp;rsquo;s with Billy to get some icy cream and he got some foody food. Stupid rule there, he won a free McFlurry and gave the coupon to me, but they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t let me use it till the next time I went to McD&amp;rsquo;s. Yo, it&amp;rsquo;s 11:11. I hope I win a playstation 2 with my McD&amp;rsquo;s winnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much else to say. Missed half of American Idol to talk to my girlfriend online and didn&amp;rsquo;t regret it whatsoever. Although I did kinda want to see Reuben and Clay. Kimberly Locke was INSANE though! Jesus Christ that girl has pipes. She sang Bonnie Raitt&amp;rsquo;s I can&amp;rsquo;t make you love me… and it was earth shattering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is so late. And I&amp;rsquo;m still awake writing in my live journal. Why? I just finished my freakin&amp;rsquo; essay for English but it&amp;rsquo;s not even good or complete. I&amp;rsquo;m planning to finish it tommorow morning or maybe even at school in Ms. Ingram&amp;rsquo;s room. I wish teachers freakin&amp;rsquo; understood the kinda shit we have to go through in this damn show process. I&amp;rsquo;m also just lazy… but blaming it on the show is the easiest and most valid thing I can think of.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt; I have a slight runny nose. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping it doesn&amp;rsquo;t develop into anything more than just a slight runny nose. Runny noses are probably better than scrambled noses, and scrambled noses are better than fried ones. Man, I forget who it was that said that the Foo Fighters first record was all Dave Grohl. Uh uh. Just got it from the library today and it&amp;rsquo;s definetely an actual band and not just Grohl. People and their stupid assumptions. ASSumptions. Haha…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m drinking Ice Tea – Lemonade. Possibly the best invention ever. Besides scrambled noses. Yo quiero la musica… Ah good ol Oasis. Dya know what you mean? Fuckin great records these guys made. I need Heathen Chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Went to the library today to get new CDs… and this guy at the checkout line (librarian) asked me where I was from and if I was muslim. I said yeah, and he asked if I practiced Islam and I told him not really. He acted like a real jackass about it. &amp;ldquo;I do think it&amp;rsquo;s one of the most beautiful religions though.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Think? Man, you got to be about it!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuck that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not against any sorta religion. I&amp;rsquo;m not against God. Hell, if I had to pick some sort of religion to follow it would probably be Islam. The thing is though that I&amp;rsquo;m open to so many different ideas. I absolutely love Buddhism, I think it&amp;rsquo;s gorgeous. The thing that Buddhism has that Islam doesn&amp;rsquo;t it is a physical element. Almost a psychological feel, and I really like that it isn&amp;rsquo;t about the sky falling and creating the earth… it&amp;rsquo;s about the deep inner core of emotion, and what creates fear and anxiety and how we can battle it. But maybe that&amp;rsquo;s more Zen than it is Buddhism… although Zen stems from Buddhism. People like that, I feel sorry for. Believe what you want to believe in but don&amp;rsquo;t come and try to push it on me, because chances are I&amp;rsquo;m following my own path and I&amp;rsquo;m not interested in yours. Yet another principle of Zen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then at night I went to McDonalds with PJ and Jon. Being a senior is so awesome. And PJ created a quiz to find out which Senor you are. I got myself but that&amp;rsquo;s because I answered all the questions honestly. They were pretty in tune to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Went for a walk around the stone bridge lake with Christine. Relaxing and great for a gorgeous day like today. It&amp;rsquo;s so much fun spending time with her, and I never want it to run out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose all time&amp;rsquo;s eventually gonna run out, but apparently a moment is only as long as you hold it… so I just gotta work on holding in these moments longer I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, we perform for the middle schoolers tommorow. That&amp;rsquo;s gonna be a tonna fun. I&amp;rsquo;m kinda getting sick of the show now, and I just want it to be over so I can get back to normal life and actually doing (half ass) work instead of no work at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy shit. 11:33. I gotta go to sleep or I&amp;rsquo;m never gonna be able to handle tommorow. Quick did I leave anything out about my day today? Nope… I think I&amp;rsquo;m good. Sleeping time now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am the biggest chewing gum addict ever. I&amp;rsquo;m eating eclipse gum and listening to the sound of the washing machine bang against my wall. It&amp;rsquo;s annoying as hell and I&amp;rsquo;m about to ready to pop in a really loud cd with the subwoofer on. Here we go. Let&amp;rsquo;s see… how bout some… Sigur Ros! Yeah… good choice if I do say so myself. Now this is relaxing. Wowwwwww… I can&amp;rsquo;t even type, I need to lie down or some shit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;First weekend of shows and I&amp;rsquo;m really happy. I was reading my book on Zen the other day and it said that you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to live every moment fully, and let everything just go. It sounds really easy, but it&amp;rsquo;s the hardest thing in the world to do. Letting go of fears is so hard and aggrivating sometimes, and I alwyas think that I&amp;rsquo;m working hard on it… when I really am just taking it easy and letting my fears eat me. I hate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depressed, a little. At least Les Mis is going well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight was fantastic. Everything went perfectly and the revolve worked at the right times, it was really a fun night to be playing. Sarah said something kinda thought provoking… the fact that we&amp;rsquo;re 18 and being in Les Mis is something that not a lot of people can say that they did. I&amp;rsquo;m really proud and excited about this production. It&amp;rsquo;s everything that I wanted my last musical at Wootton to be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I got there at like 4:30 cuz my sister had crew shit to take care of. So I hung around with Peter J for a while and got into costume. I think I was on tonight… I just hope it&amp;rsquo;s the same for tommorow&amp;rsquo;s performance, because I have so many people that I know coming. I mean, the washington post is coming, nick blamire, mariam &amp;amp; crew, my parents… it&amp;rsquo;s just gonna be sick. So I gotta do the same thing that I did tonight, even though my voice is really fucked right now. No one that I&amp;rsquo;m hardcore friends with showed up tonight…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a little worried about Andy… he&amp;rsquo;s not being too joyful about the show, although I know that he feels joyful about it. Hopefully by tommorow he&amp;rsquo;ll be feeling better about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The after party was fun. It was at Brandon Gage&amp;rsquo;s house and there was pizza and fun people. Now I&amp;rsquo;m just riddiculously tired and on such a high from a great fucking show. Sleep time&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My last rehearsal on the Wootton stage today. Didn&amp;rsquo;t feel any different from other rehearsals. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna feel it later I&amp;rsquo;m sure. Well tommorow&amp;rsquo;s the night… apache and freshman game… and opening night. It really crept up… especially since I came into rehearsals a month into the picture. It will be SO incredibly nice to not have rehearsal after school anymore. To think, my sister and I are actually going to come home tommorow! Haha!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Well here&amp;rsquo;s the bottom line : our show is ready. Even though we missed like 5 rehearsals we are so caught up and so ready to get this shit on. Brodsky even said our show looked amazing. Really good. He complemented me! Said that I had passion. That was cool of him, it made me feel good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can tell this show&amp;rsquo;s gonna be mad crazy cool. Goin out with a bang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sister and mom shouting now. Eyes closing. Sleepy time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The show looks fantastic. We put a lot of work into it today but I&amp;rsquo;m not really thinking about that right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom told me about the safety precautions we need to take if there&amp;rsquo;s an emergency. I know it&amp;rsquo;s just something that she has to do in order to keep us safe, but it&amp;rsquo;s scares the shit outta me. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot of things I need to do before I die, so it really can&amp;rsquo;t be now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The play we&amp;rsquo;re doing is quite symbolic. It&amp;rsquo;s really going to affect people as they watch, and I&amp;rsquo;m kinda nervous about that. Interesting that we are doing a play about a war when there is a war going on… and the war is happening right near opening night. It&amp;rsquo;s crazy, and right now I&amp;rsquo;m just trying to step outside of my fears and just chill. Going to sleep right now would be the best idea…. so that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m going to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also a little worried about the stress levels of people in the show. I think with the war, opening night, and school shit, we&amp;rsquo;re really floundering. But it&amp;rsquo;ll all be awesome when we&amp;rsquo;re on that hill dancing the Apache. Thoughts of that are keeping me alive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom AND dad forgot it was their anniversary today. Haha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, it truly is bed time. I&amp;rsquo;m thankful for everything that I got, because I&amp;rsquo;m realizing now that it isn&amp;rsquo;t all stable. So here&amp;rsquo;s to whatever stuff life&amp;rsquo;s made of.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;David you&amp;rsquo;re probably gonna be the first person to read this. Or maybe the only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been telling everyone to step outside recently, and what I mean is, step outside of your stress, your tension, whatevers holding you down. Once you step outside of that and take a look at yourself, it all seems so meaningless and stupid. I forget how to do that sometimes, and it takes some effort. Elyssa said she took my advice and it made her feel better about life, so I&amp;rsquo;m kinda glad. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting, Billy doesn&amp;rsquo;t ever get stressed. Well he mentioned being stressed about college apps and stuff, but generally he&amp;rsquo;s pretty calm about things. If there&amp;rsquo;s one thing I admire about Billy it&amp;rsquo;s that thing. I wish I could be like that – and recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been moving more in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Elyssa said she took my advice and it made her feel better about life, so I&amp;rsquo;m kinda glad. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting, Billy doesn&amp;rsquo;t ever get stressed. Well he mentioned being stressed about college apps and stuff, but generally he&amp;rsquo;s pretty calm about things. If there&amp;rsquo;s one thing I admire about Billy it&amp;rsquo;s that thing. I wish I could be like that – and recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been moving more in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t written here in a long while … the show has been taking up time hardcore and I&amp;rsquo;m glad that it&amp;rsquo;s finally ending. I mean, not that my experience in Wootton Theater… or actually in theater in general is ending… but I mean it&amp;rsquo;s really about time that I start doing other things with my time. Like writign in my live journal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show is going superbly well. I dunno if that&amp;rsquo;s even a word. Everybody&amp;rsquo;s stressed out… cast is down each other&amp;rsquo;s throats, crew&amp;rsquo;s there till 2 am everyday, brodsky is annoying everybody… but this is the meat that good memories are made of! And that ain&amp;rsquo;t even sarcastic. Nah, when it&amp;rsquo;s all said and done we&amp;rsquo;ll all be lookin back on the show with fond memories and warm hearts. Really sounds like a fairy tale but I swear it&amp;rsquo;ll happen. Christine was right, she was saying that everybody needs to have respect for everybody else no matter what, and then things will really run smoothly. I guess that means swallowing your pride and putting yourself on a stage with 60 other people, and smiling cuz you love it. I guess it means focusing on your tasks, and the things YOU have to do. I guess it means realizing that there is no Me, there is no I, there&amp;rsquo;s only a production that needs hardcore focus and dedication. Once we all get over ourselves, all we have left to do is tweak this already fantastic show into something phenomenal. My biggest challenge will be having respect for the people that don&amp;rsquo;t have respect for me, and not fighting fire with fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My arm hurts whenever I breathe in, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why. I have an english essay due tommorow and I&amp;rsquo;m not doing it. Big surprise there. Hopefully Ms. J will be down with it. And if not… well it&amp;rsquo;s not her fault. I don&amp;rsquo;t blame her. But I also don&amp;rsquo;t blame me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m putting everything on hold for this week and then it&amp;rsquo;ll all be over. Nothing to worry about for a loooonnggg time. Oh, that is really really good to think about. I&amp;rsquo;m listening to the greatest music right now, Herbie Hancock… it&amp;rsquo;s a song that is really popular that they use a lot on commercials but I don&amp;rsquo;t know the name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;rsquo;re going to war? World War III? Terror alert raised to orange?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know NOTHING about politics. Everybody&amp;rsquo;s anti war it seems besides Chris &amp;amp; Billy. I have no opinion. It&amp;rsquo;s not like I don&amp;rsquo;t care, there are a lotta people that don&amp;rsquo;t care. It&amp;rsquo;s like, I don&amp;rsquo;t have anywhere near enough knowledge to have an opinion. When Chris &amp;amp; Billy support their pro war stance, it all sounds valid, and the same for anti-war people. So I have nothing to really say on the matter, except that I hope not too many innocent people die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching CDs right now. What should I listen to? Ah the postal service. Let&amp;rsquo;s hear it for new music!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring has finally sprung! It feels fucking good to be alive in spring. I wrote a springy instrumental tune about a year ago for Laura and Utkarsh and his friend helped me record it again a couple days ago with some fucking cool guitar solos (courtesy of ut&amp;rsquo;s friend Joby) and some freestyle vocals from utkarsh. I&amp;rsquo;m still gonna redo it, but it sounds really cool. My guitar should be at the store on Saturday morning. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to be able to play it again. I already miss it and it&amp;rsquo;s been a couple days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to spring. Favorite season. Cuz it&amp;rsquo;s like…. winter winter winter… SPRING! And it really does spring out at you. And it just feels so warm and nice, you can chill out in short sleeves and fly a kite with your hunny. When the show is over I plan to get caught up on school, fly my kite a lot, and be with my hunny a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is spinning round and round right now and I&amp;rsquo;m trying to spin around to stay in sync with it. The thrill of the chase. You know writing this journal entry has been goo therapy, it&amp;rsquo;s forced me step outside of my problems and check em out from the shell. It really ain&amp;rsquo;t so bad, and it&amp;rsquo;s all winding down anyway. Expect a tired, mean, nasty entry tommorow from me, getting home at 10 pm. Nah, just fuckin. Expect a thoughtful one. Hope tommorow goes better than today.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m having the worst day I have had in a very long while. Something my sister said to me made me really sad. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go into detail about it, mainly because I&amp;rsquo;m really depressed about it right now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t made an entry in a while, and that&amp;rsquo;s totally cool with me, because I just didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like writing. But once again, now I do. And I guess that&amp;rsquo;s the way things should always work, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rehearsals have started to pick up again, and I dig it a lot. I&amp;rsquo;m at school till late but I&amp;rsquo;m occupied. And plus, I get to see Christine more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last entry I made I was feeling really in place, and everything was feeling nice. And it keeps flip flopping between that and this feeling of torture. School should be really easy right now but it isn&amp;rsquo;t, mainly because of theory and the terrible job that Relland is doing. Luckily, Ingram is tutoring me, or at least she did today and it helped a lot. I learned in one class period what I coudln&amp;rsquo;t figure out for an entire semester, and that ain&amp;rsquo;t no lie.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;My sister is angry with me because I hate driving her home everyday. Well I do. Shes annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom is prodding me to call Sue Kline, she works at NPR which on American&amp;rsquo;s campus, and my mom thinks I should call her and ask for a job. I don&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable with that and I think my mom knows it. I&amp;rsquo;m exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Idol is tonight. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to watch it, I really hope frenchie stays. But I&amp;rsquo;m sure she will, I can&amp;rsquo;t really see America bumping her off unless they have a damn good reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like I don&amp;rsquo;t belong at all. Everybody probably feels like that. Maybe I read into stuff too much, or maybe I&amp;rsquo;m paranoid, but there&amp;rsquo;s always that one glimmer of possibility, and that&amp;rsquo;s what people like me thrive on. I bet you that Truman had suspcions his entire life, but all his friends told him he was paranoid. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the same way for me. Not as extreme obviously, I&amp;rsquo;m not living a TV show, but maybe I&amp;rsquo;m being mislead. Wish I knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d write about my life in more detail but I&amp;rsquo;m just too exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s funny I can&amp;rsquo;t even remember what happened yesterday. Oh yeah! It was review day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well anyway, I was pretty nervous for my english exam since I never read books. I wrote my first essay in like 1.25 hours, really well too, and then I came back to my Hamlet essay. I thought I did pretty badly, but it was what she wanted, so I guess I&amp;rsquo;m cool. Glad to know that&amp;rsquo;s over. Also glad that we exams today, I got to be with Christine. We had a whole chat about me being intimidated by her friends. I used to just feel like they hated me, but truly I&amp;rsquo;m just afraid to the accept the fact that I may be liked by them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;here is definetely a first time for everything. Usually when it&amp;rsquo;s a possible snowday I get really hopeful that they will cancel school. But I just don&amp;rsquo;t feel that way about tommorow. I want school so I can get my exam done and then go out to brunch with my girlfriend. That&amp;rsquo;d be a great day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I recieved my last math quiz in high school EVER. I was so excited about that. My grades are looking like this for the end of the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;think I&amp;rsquo;m Bi Polar. Honestly. Tonight started off in the worst mood ever. I felt like shit, and like I had no friends. Then for some reason all of a sudden that attitude changed and I felt really happy. I feel like bouncing off the walls. If I&amp;rsquo;m not bi polar, there is definetely something wrong with me. How can a person go from a really really sad state to a really happy state within like an hour?? I won&amp;rsquo;t question it. It&amp;rsquo;s a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Well let&amp;rsquo;s see. What happened today. It snowed, a dusting but enough that my car was covered in a layer of snow. So it took me a while to defrost, but luckily everything went according to schedule. Like everything in life, the traffic in the morning follows a certain pattern. If I get thrown off, then EVERYTHING gets thrown off. If I&amp;rsquo;m a minute late, I&amp;rsquo;ll miss the green light that won&amp;rsquo;t turn green for another 3 mins. It&amp;rsquo;s crazy. Well not really, it&amp;rsquo;s just the way traffic works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stat quiz went pretty badly. But I&amp;rsquo;m not worried, getting a C this quarter would be fine, I just need to do really well on the exam, and like billy said that shoudln&amp;rsquo;t be too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Found out I have a B in psych no matter what. Love that feeling. Crew was cancelled, so I got to hang out with my baby. She was a little hesitant at first, she wanted the afternoon to herself. But eventually she gave in :-). We hung out for an hour and I loved it. We just sat there and talked in my bed. I told her corny things and she swallowed it. It was beautiful, it was exactly how I want our relationship to be. I really love Christine. I&amp;rsquo;m even starting to like Subway because of her. Heh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a nut… a real nut. Then I got home and got on instant messenger. For some reason, a reason that I don&amp;rsquo;t understand now, I was jealous of not being in Laura&amp;rsquo;s profile. Like I always am. But right now, I&amp;rsquo;m thinking back on it, and wondering why the hell I felt that way. Christine really is great to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hungry. Gotta go eat.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was a pretty interesting day. Once again I had that weird feeling in my gut that something was wrong. Christine tried to convince me it&amp;rsquo;s just the end of the semester blues. It should all go away once the craziness is gone in a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a math quiz tommorow and I don&amp;rsquo;t know a single thing. Some would say that I&amp;rsquo;m screwed. I shut off the vent in my house and it is still freezing cold.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I wanted those headphones that they had in store, the Koss Td-80&amp;rsquo;s. The sound is phenomenal on those baby&amp;rsquo;s. I went out and bought them and they sucked. So uncomfortable. So I traded them in for the newer model. I wear them now but I just put on my old sony&amp;rsquo;s. What a warm sound. Sure it&amp;rsquo;s a little muddy sometimes… but it&amp;rsquo;s so comfortable. You really forget that they are on your head. I need create a headphone one day that does what the TD-80 does, with the comfort of the Sony&amp;rsquo;s. You think that the Koss people would take that into account when they are making their phones! But no.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You think that the Koss people would take that into account when they are making their phones! But no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway. Today was a typical Monday. I woke in an OK mood cuz I had done most of my homework. My sister had a science project to attend to, so I ended up just driving myself and Christine to school. It was nice for her to be in the front for a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again in math I didn&amp;rsquo;t have my HW but I don&amp;rsquo;t think she marked off for it. I made some cute little remark about how I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know what I was doing and just wrote something, and she just laughed. It&amp;rsquo;s gonna be nice not to have that class next semester. I just need to do well on the freaking exam. As long as I get good semester grades, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty much set for the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing special happened in school today. I read my Football story for my creative writing class and they seemed to dig it… I felt good. First time in that class where I think I read something that I was proud of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I came home directly after school, for some reason feeling like total shit. Slept for 3 hours. Woke up and Christine was online… suddenly remembered where I was and felt a lot better. Talked to Grant too. I swear that Grant&amp;rsquo;s some sorta gift or something, he&amp;rsquo;s the perfect friend. The guy who always sticks up for you even when he knows you&amp;rsquo;re wrong. And he&amp;rsquo;s one of the very few people I know that like Toad. But then again, I introduced him to Toad in Egypt. I guess that&amp;rsquo;s why we like music we heard in Egypt so much. All of my favorite records were bought while I was in Egypt… or at least over that period of time. Duncan Sheik, Dog&amp;rsquo;s Eye View, 3 Toad records. All my favorites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read some more about time travel! Still can&amp;rsquo;t figure out if scientists generally think it&amp;rsquo;s possible or not. Some say physics won&amp;rsquo;t allow it, some say it will. I went down to the bookshelf down stairs and took out a few books that I think could help me figure out more about time travel. Some Madeleine L&amp;rsquo;Engle… just because she is a KILLER storyteller. And she has a concept of what time travel is and how it works. And I like the way she describes it. Some of those preteen books are REALLY gripping, and I&amp;rsquo;m not even kidding. I found HG Wells&amp;rsquo; The Time Machine. See what his take is on it. Then some book called I Ching… apparently has some wisdom. I&amp;rsquo;m willing to try it. An Asimov book of short stories, I figured it might be interesting. A book of Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s early comedies, just cuz the guy rules. He really does. And the tibetan book of the dead, my dad&amp;rsquo;s recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Millionaire was on tonight. Heidi was eliminated! Go Joe! I dig this guy. Still think he shoulda kept Dana though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents are leaning more and more towards me staying at home next year. And I don&amp;rsquo;t want to, but I&amp;rsquo;m starting to think that I really have no choice unless things change financially. It&amp;rsquo;s my choice – I picked an expensive school. Granted it&amp;rsquo;s the only one of the few that has my major………… but I still wish there was a cheaper school. I shoulda applied to the regular program….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toad rules. Two more months! What&amp;rsquo;s on a agenda for tommorow. Maybe a little trip to the library, maybe see Utkarsh if he&amp;rsquo;s home. Homework has become a thing of the past to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love: like an infant trying to stand up.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a fantastic day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up at like 11 and hung around in my house till 2. I picked Christine up and we went to eat at subway, and then went to White Flint, cuz she had a Borders gift certificate. She was in between a journal, Dante&amp;rsquo;s Inferno, and some other stuff, and ended up just buying a book that is all about trashy movies 🙂 The guy at the register gave her 10% off. I thought it was neat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a fantastic day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up at like 11 and hung around in my house till 2. I picked Christine up and we went to eat at subway, and then went to White Flint, cuz she had a Borders gift certificate. She was in between a journal, Dante&amp;rsquo;s Inferno, and some other stuff, and ended up just buying a book that is all about trashy movies 🙂 The guy at the register gave her 10% off. I thought it was neat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rented the Breakfast Club, mainly because she had never seen it, and I really wanted to see it again, without the TV edits. She enjoyed it, so I was happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the best thing ever – even though I missed the Vaco show last night, I still got the new CD courtesy of Sami, and it&amp;rsquo;s absolutely amazing. It makes me feel so much better about life right now… and I really needed that. Wish I had seen the show – but this is a great way of making up for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I just had a half hour talk with Utkarsh online.. he&amp;rsquo;s leaving India tommorow. He met Kal Penn, the guy from American Desi who played the ghetto guy, on a train in India. I think that&amp;rsquo;s the coolest thing EVER. Apparnetly he&amp;rsquo;s not ghetto in real life. Damn actors and their ability to convince me that they&amp;rsquo;re the same person in real life. Apparently he&amp;rsquo;s in Van Wilder too. Fuckin cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This VaCo cd is making me feel great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well I have to practice for Mr. Wootton tommorow at Jeff&amp;rsquo;s house. It&amp;rsquo;s gonna rock, roll, and do all that. But I&amp;rsquo;ll probably be late… too tired to get up at 10:30. Please let the practice go well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well now I&amp;rsquo;m gonna get offline and talk to Laura on the phone for a bit, probably fall asleep with my headset on and wake up with a swollen ear. Vaco Rules. SERIOUSLY. Ok, that&amp;rsquo;s all I gotta say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently in space there are these things called Black Holes. And apparently the connection between two black holes is a worm hole. And if you go inside a wormhole, you&amp;rsquo;ll travel into the future. But of course if you go inside a black hole, you die. So, I guess time travel will never really be proven now will it. However, if we found some way to get a wormhole on earth and maintain that worm hole… speed it up to the speed of light, then get another wormhole and speed it up faster, to the destination we wanted to go to, we could techincally create a time machine. I really really want to try that. I want that to be my senior project or something. But, the cool thing is that, we can get to anywhere in the universe within 4 years, if we were to travel at the speed of light. Like if we wanted to travel to the planet Zardoff, we&amp;rsquo;d spend 1 year accelerating to the speed of light, and then another year decellerating. We&amp;rsquo;d end up at the planet, come right home using the same process. Except while we would be 4 years older, earth would be 4.4 million years older. No one would even REMEMBER us, and unless we left some sort of system, some sort of group of people who&amp;rsquo;d be waiting for our arrival… we&amp;rsquo;d get so fucked. It&amp;rsquo;d be like a buncha crazy people who are &amp;ldquo;waiting for God,&amp;rdquo; or something. 4.4 million years though. That is SO long, we could all be dead by then! I&amp;rsquo;m really getting into this time travel stuff. I&amp;rsquo;ll post updates when I learn new stuff. God my cell phone is loud when it is telling me it&amp;rsquo;s out of batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today. I woke up at 11, and realized I was supposed to be at PJ&amp;rsquo;s to practice for Mr. Wootton. We&amp;rsquo;re doing a cover of Tenacious D song called Wonderboy. Sounded DAMN good today. We finished up around 1 and went to get some food. My ATM card didn&amp;rsquo;t process, so I had to borrow money from Aaron, and I have to pay him back tommorow. Let&amp;rsquo;s see, then what. I went home and my aunt and uncle were here for a bit. They&amp;rsquo;re really cool but I never seem to have anything interesting to say to them… so our relationship remains simply at a nephew-uncle/aunt relationsip. Then I hung around for a bit and Christine came over to watch Simpsons. Funny thing though, they started playing a rerun and then realized it was a rerun and skipped into the new one. So we didn&amp;rsquo;t get to see the first 10 mins or so. Then Christine had tons of homework to do, so she went home. And THEN my dad told me I have to take my sister to school tommorow 15 mins early. But it ain&amp;rsquo;t happening. Christine&amp;rsquo;s line was busy so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get through to tell her. It just isn&amp;rsquo;t fair to do that to her. That, and I REALLY don&amp;rsquo;t want to wake up that early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope my sister does well on her project, she worked REALLY hard on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that&amp;rsquo;s all I gotta say for now. Just did all my hw. Now I&amp;rsquo;m gonna read more about time travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you just pretend?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Saturday morning and I feel so much better. Everything that was bugging me yesterday stopped bugging me. I just sorta took a look around and realized where I was and I was happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris, Christine, and I played Literati last night online… I didn&amp;rsquo;t know you could use wild cards! I thought they were just unusable… so I was like 20 points behind the whole game. But if I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been I woulda whooped some ass. Chris won the game, and it was really close to. The last move was up to him and he had 149 and Christine had 154… and he jumped ahead to 160 and used all his letters. It was QUITE the game. I felt like a spectator…I basically gave up in the middle of the game.&lt;br&gt;
PJ and Chris and I all hung out last night. We went to Starbucks and also to Taco Bell (where of course we saw the wootteners that are always at Taco Bell) and then we just chilled for a little bit. It was exactly the type of evening I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;We met some cops at Taco Bell and PJ asked them what they could charge him with if he took a shit on someone&amp;rsquo;s lawn. The cop kinda glared at him… and said that the only thing they could get him for would be indecent exposure. But man, it was funny. So I guess that means PJ will be shitting on people&amp;rsquo;s lawns more from now on. So you betta watch out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I stayed on the phone with Christine till like 2 in the morning…. and that&amp;rsquo;s always the best. And I went to sleep happy, listening to … what the fuck was I listening to?? It wasn&amp;rsquo;t MBV… it was… wait maybe it was MBV. I&amp;rsquo;m checking. NAW, it was Pat Metheny &amp;amp; Charlie Haden. I knew it was something acoustic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well today&amp;rsquo;s gonna be a great day. I can already feel it 🙂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll write again tonight so that this day is accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quarter to six and I&amp;rsquo;m sitting in my room eating noodles. The weekend has begun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was a really horrible day. I started off by telling Christine about how I thought it was going to be a terrible day for some reason, and she disagreed, and said that my day is only as good as I think it&amp;rsquo;s going to be. So if I think it&amp;rsquo;s going to bad it&amp;rsquo;ll be bad, and vice versa. But I guess I was right.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

So if I think it&amp;rsquo;s going to bad it&amp;rsquo;ll be bad, and vice versa. But I guess I was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Jenny if she blocked me from her buddylist, cuz I never see her online anymore. And she kinda stumbled and said she blocked everybody until they IM her. Only thing is that&amp;rsquo;s impossible since no one can IM you when they are blocked. But well, I coudln&amp;rsquo;t expect her to just be like &amp;ldquo;yeah, i blocked you cuz i don&amp;rsquo;t like you.&amp;rdquo; I mean I can&amp;rsquo;t blame her, I&amp;rsquo;d probably make something up too like that, if I blocked someone I found annoying. It&amp;rsquo;s just bringing back all my self esteem issues that I thought I was free of. I guess I didn&amp;rsquo;t really talk to her that much online, but obviously I&amp;rsquo;m not cool enough or something. I&amp;rsquo;m not being overdramatic. Dramatic yes, but not over. Coulda been anyone… I just can&amp;rsquo;t tell anymore. People say I&amp;rsquo;m just paranoid, but I&amp;rsquo;m really not. I feel so crappy. Laura brought up the fact that most of the time I am paranoid. She&amp;rsquo;s right… but sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s just really hard to differentiate between thinking you&amp;rsquo;re disliked and actually being disliked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I think is funny is certain people can do certain things and look really cool, but another person can do the same certain things and be called an idiot. If someone hotter made my type of jokes, people would laugh at them instead of cringing. I&amp;rsquo;m happy for my friends though. I mean, happy I have them. And also happy that things are working out most of them. Just waitin&amp;rsquo; on news from Billy on college, and then all my friends will be in college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PJ and I totally seized the day yesterday. We just randomly decided to go to Taco Bell after school and order a taco each. It was great, the weather was nice and tacos are always good. I still felt kinda bad yesterday too. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out why. I&amp;rsquo;m just glad that I&amp;rsquo;m seeing Christine tommorow. And my other friends tonight. Really if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for them I&amp;rsquo;d be really alone. But then again, without friends you probably get used to solitude. And probably enjoy it. It is SO cold in the house right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m glad I&amp;rsquo;m finally getting my thoughts out again. It&amp;rsquo;s making me feel great, and what&amp;rsquo;s especially great is that no one really reads this. I&amp;rsquo;m really glad about that. Hah, I bet 24 people are reading this right now. Well, at least I&amp;rsquo;ll never know. I COULD make this entry private, but truthfully, I like going to the page at the end and seeing it there :-). I don&amp;rsquo;t know why, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure all LJ users do it. I just yawned while chewing gum and it stuck to the roof of my mouth, I was getting really afraid of it falling down and me choking to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the math quiz yesterday went pretty badly. I forgot to divide by 2 on the back and forget EVERYTHING on the front. Maybe she&amp;rsquo;ll give me credit for showing the work. Cuz I knew my shit, it was just a matter of dividing the shit by 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well my mom just told me that we&amp;rsquo;re going out tommorow night for Aunt &amp;amp; Uncle&amp;rsquo;s anniversary. But I already made plans with Christine, so she&amp;rsquo;ll have to suck it up and deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steph and Lauren stopped by today in school to say hi to Ingram. It was cool to see them, it&amp;rsquo;s good to know they haven&amp;rsquo;t changed too much. But then again I only saw em for like an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Found out yesterday the lead singer of the New Radicals wrote the new Santana/Michelle Branch. I think that&amp;rsquo;s awesome – he&amp;rsquo;s such an awesome producer and songwriter, yet he never made it anywhere with his own music, besides one-hit-wonderdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was supposed to go to Vaco tonight with Sami and her friends. I just didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like staying up till 2 in the morning… and it&amp;rsquo;d be my 7th Vaco show or so. Maybe 8th. I just gave Sami money to buy me the new record, and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait for it. I personally think it will be their best yet. So many great songs, especially Johnny Wonder. That&amp;rsquo;s probably my most current favorite VaCo song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well I&amp;rsquo;m feeling shitty enough that I want to go to sleep. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll change the layout of my live journal so it&amp;rsquo;s easier on the eyes before I do that. I&amp;rsquo;m just looking forward to Toad. Only a couple months or so now. Hope it doesn&amp;rsquo;t sell out in two seconds. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait till tommorow. She always makes me feel amazing again. Being sappy sure, but can&amp;rsquo;t help but write what I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll fly to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a lotta tension in my house right now. And I&amp;rsquo;m in my stomach. God I&amp;rsquo;m hungry. There&amp;rsquo;s never anything to eat though, my mom either buys reallly crappy food or total junk food. Well junk food it is. Be right back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sister is bawling in my parents room for no particular reason. I hate it when she does this. She just moans and whines and doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop complaining about how horrible life is. Granted I&amp;rsquo;ve been in that position, but she just needs to realize where she is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I had a whole talk with Jason about realizing where you are. Where anyone is. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to forget sometimes where you are, b ut it&amp;rsquo;s also easy to be reminded or to remind yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re still yelling. This is terrible. It&amp;rsquo;s 11:30 at night, and I just wanna go to sleep. But they want to keep yelling as if no one is sleeping. And my mom acts like she&amp;rsquo;s trying to get her to stop, but she&amp;rsquo;s just fueling the fire even more. Then my dad tries to intervene, and then everything gets so fucked up. If I was truly immersed in my practice of Zen, this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t affect me. Guess that just shows me how far along I am. It&amp;rsquo;s killing me, and all they&amp;rsquo;re doing is screaming. I can&amp;rsquo;t concentrate on anything and all I want to do is go to sleep. And if I don&amp;rsquo;t get a good grade on my quiz tommorow that could be a bad grade in math… I just don&amp;rsquo;t to get kicked out of AU. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that I&amp;rsquo;m worrying for no real reason, since I&amp;rsquo;m already admitted and that I&amp;rsquo;d have to do HORRIBLY to get kicked out. And I&amp;rsquo;m still above a 3.0. There&amp;rsquo;s always that off chance though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second semester is really taking it&amp;rsquo;s time coming. It&amp;rsquo;s the break I&amp;rsquo;ve needed for the past 3.5 years. No math, science, or history. I just need to make it through first semester without getting my ass kicked. And while it isn&amp;rsquo;t getting kicked yet, I can definetely see a future ass kicking possible. I got a 50 on the psych test. That brought me down to a 82. So I have to do really well on that. That shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too hard. What&amp;rsquo;s really hard is the stat quiz tommorow. I really wish I was a harder worker. I could get through this easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sister just came in and apologized for making loud whining and noises and then asked if I&amp;rsquo;m embarassed by her. And I said no. But I did admit that I coudln&amp;rsquo;t study or concentrate with her wailing in the background. All I have to do to be happy tommorow is do well on the stat quiz. If I do that then I&amp;rsquo;ll be set. I really hate math so much. My dad was kinda upset that I&amp;rsquo;m dropping out of math second semester, but I really deserve a break from it. It&amp;rsquo;s just too much sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be fine. Really. All I need is some nerd jumprope and some girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PJ&amp;rsquo;s act for Mr. Wootton is going to be AMAZING. Like smashing and phenomenal. Record breaking for the volume of the applause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I was gonna write about the chorus concert, so I guess I will. It was fun, I guess. I conducted decently. Went to Fudd&amp;rsquo;s after that, and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been there in a while. I considered using my credit card to pay for the meal but I had cash so it didn&amp;rsquo;t matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well just talked to Mariam. All that stuff I said about college – I don&amp;rsquo;t think I have to worry. At least, I REALLY hope not. Please, no surprises. I really can&amp;rsquo;t stand them. I&amp;rsquo;m on a set course, and I wanna stay there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  A very eventful day in the life of the Z.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up at 5:15, COMPLETELY expecting a 2 hour delay. The worst thing is, my mom walked in my room and started picking stuff up off the ground without saying anything… I figured maybe she was letting me sleep, since it was a 2 hour delay. Then she said &amp;ldquo;Isn&amp;rsquo;t about time to get up?&amp;rdquo; I was so mad. All I wanted was two more hours of sleep. I am really staying up late these days. I mean it&amp;rsquo;s like 11:15 right now. That is late for me. My eyes are completely bloodshot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I mean it&amp;rsquo;s like 11:15 right now. That is late for me. My eyes are completely bloodshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived 5 minutes later at school than we normally do. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what that was due to. I left on time and got Christine on time. Somewhere in between I guess something was outta whack. Maybe cuz of the ice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I missed a lot of first period because I had to go and announce the chorus concert on the announcements. That was fun, missing Stat is always fun. Apparently, Gerst is training me for TV Internship next semester. At least it&amp;rsquo;s not someone I can&amp;rsquo;t stand. Although I can&amp;rsquo;t think of anyone I can&amp;rsquo;t stand in that class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a C- on the last essay on Tess that we had to write. She said it was one of the most complex essays she&amp;rsquo;s ever given a buncha kids to write. So a C- really isn&amp;rsquo;t that bad. I really think she has something against me or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day went normally. We had a sub in Theory so of course I skipped and went to see Christine. She looked cute with her glasses. Even cuter without. Then in Creative Writing, Ms. Jones told me the journal entries I wrote were the lamest things she&amp;rsquo;s ever read. And that I need to do something brilliant for her by the end of the quarter, because she didn&amp;rsquo;t want those to be the last memories she knew of me. I reminded her that we have a whole bunch of new memories to make 2nd semester since I have her for AP Lit. Apparnetly she&amp;rsquo;s going to go easy on us… I hope that&amp;rsquo;s a truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I&amp;rsquo;m failing Theory. I think there are like 10 assignments that I haven&amp;rsquo;t turned in. And if I had turned them in, they are of very poor quality. I hope our midterm assignment isn&amp;rsquo;t something really hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in 7th period I tried to conduct the chorus, and that was ridicculous. I can&amp;rsquo;t conduct worth shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well I&amp;rsquo;m exhuasted, I&amp;rsquo;ll write about the chorus concert tommorow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God it&amp;rsquo;s way too late to be up, yet I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was Monday, a snowday, and it was a pretty good day all in all. I woke up around 11 or so and had a bagel for breakfast. And jesus, I just realized I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten out of the house at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I took David&amp;rsquo;s lyrics and worked the shit out of them. The guy&amp;rsquo;s got such talent… I wanted to write some music to the lyrics that worked and made a tune that did the lyrics justice. So I worked from like… 2-7 on it. Took about 2 hours to get the tracks down and about another 3 to mix the whole thing. The hardest thing was placing the beat in it so that it worked. And getting rid of some lyrics that might&amp;rsquo;ve been important to him. Then I had to add another verse… truly a dual effort. So today&amp;rsquo;s been quite productive, and I feel really good about the recording. He hears it tommorow… will get the verdict then.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;God it&amp;rsquo;s way too late to be up, yet I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was Monday, a snowday, and it was a pretty good day all in all. I woke up around 11 or so and had a bagel for breakfast. And jesus, I just realized I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten out of the house at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I took David&amp;rsquo;s lyrics and worked the shit out of them. The guy&amp;rsquo;s got such talent… I wanted to write some music to the lyrics that worked and made a tune that did the lyrics justice. So I worked from like… 2-7 on it. Took about 2 hours to get the tracks down and about another 3 to mix the whole thing. The hardest thing was placing the beat in it so that it worked. And getting rid of some lyrics that might&amp;rsquo;ve been important to him. Then I had to add another verse… truly a dual effort. So today&amp;rsquo;s been quite productive, and I feel really good about the recording. He hears it tommorow… will get the verdict then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched Joe Millionaire tonight. It&amp;rsquo;s that show where they tell 20 girls they&amp;rsquo;re going to compete to marry a millionaire (50 mill to be exact)… but it&amp;rsquo;s all a big lie, he makes like 19,000 a year. The chick are SO dumb. But joe&amp;rsquo;s cool, I dig him. Hopefully he won&amp;rsquo;t pick an idiot. There&amp;rsquo;s one think I really dug, but I forgot her name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;rsquo;t do any homework, but what was I expecting? Hoping for a 2 hr delay tommorow. It&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be icy… let&amp;rsquo;s hope and pray.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I never thought I&amp;rsquo;d start writing in my LiveJournal again EVER, but here I am again. In case you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, and wondering why I go around talking shit about livejournals and how they are for people who complain and shit… maybe people need that outlet. But here&amp;rsquo;s the deal… any complaining, or negative thinking that&amp;rsquo;s gonna occur will happen in a private entry. So the venting stays in the vent. And I&amp;rsquo;m disabling commenting. You can probably guess why, I don&amp;rsquo;t need comments on my life. But I mean that in a positive way. I swear that is a good thing. Any stuff that I think the public would find interesting or thoughful will remain public. And just like before, if you don&amp;rsquo;t like, don&amp;rsquo;t read. I have to admit though, I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone will care to read this. And I say that out of sheer honesty. And also in completely honesty, that&amp;rsquo;s completely irrelevant. The basis of this journal are MY thoughts and MY emotions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The basis of this journal are MY thoughts and MY emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the first day of 2003 and I&amp;rsquo;m psyched. (uhh actually, it JUST became the second, my bad). I graduate this year. It&amp;rsquo;s the year that all us seniors have been waiting for. Last night, I stayed awake till about 6:30 am… which is pretty riddiculous considering I usually go to sleep around 10 on weekdays, 2 on weekends. Anyway, so of course I was exhausted today, and I slept for about two hours from 7-9… woke up and had a chinese dinner and then tried go to back to sleep. Guess what… NO GO. So I remain restless writing in my livejournal, which I haven&amp;rsquo;t written in for… let me check… June of 2002. That&amp;rsquo;s about half a year ago. It feels awkward, but I don&amp;rsquo;t care. I need to write. Otherwise I&amp;rsquo;m going to end up wordless, and I&amp;rsquo;m gonna go nuts if that happens. Eveybody needs a diary, so here is mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This break went by slowly. Christine&amp;rsquo;s been in Hawaii so that made things go by REALLY slowly. It was lonely without her. BUT I did go to her house everyday to feed her cats. It was nice being there, even if she wasn&amp;rsquo;t. I need to go to sleep or I&amp;rsquo;ll be dead in school tommorow. Now that I&amp;rsquo;m in college, does school matter? I&amp;rsquo;m really curious about that. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it should. And besides, my schedule is going to be GREAT next semester. And by the way, 2nd semester? You couldn&amp;rsquo;t be slower in arriving, my friend. 2 more weeks of first semester torture. But it&amp;rsquo;s all relative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to try sleeping now. Here goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:01 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I showered twice today. I hardly do that, but it&amp;rsquo;s the best feeling when I do. I feel all double clean. It&amp;rsquo;s been a very drab new year so far, no sunshine at all… just rain and this really sick dizzy feeling. I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s from staying up all night (almost) on new years, but maybe it&amp;rsquo;s also from dislike of school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m reading this book right now by Thich Nhat Hanh called The Heart of the Buddha&amp;rsquo;s Teaching. It&amp;rsquo;s all about transforming your personal suffering into peace, joy, and liberation. I understand the concepts… it&amp;rsquo;s just really hard to apply them to daily life. Basically, I have to stop thinking so much, and analyzing stuff. Apparently, if I do that then I will lead a much happier life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured I&amp;rsquo;d have it easy being back at school after the new year… the teacher&amp;rsquo;s woudln&amp;rsquo;t expect us to remember all the homework we had before break, I hoped. However, they remembered, and I forgot that I had a paper due in English tommorow. It&amp;rsquo;s on sonnet 73, so it&amp;rsquo;s not supposed to be that long, but I&amp;rsquo;m still really annoyed. I really really don&amp;rsquo;t want to write it. I&amp;rsquo;m terrible at writing essays, and Dr. Pohl always gives me the shittiest grades on the essays… like D&amp;rsquo;s. I&amp;rsquo;m getting the feeling that after my horrendous summer reading essay that she got this idea that I was a really bad writer and decided that every paper after that she&amp;rsquo;d give me a low grade. Or maybe I just don&amp;rsquo;t write well… 🙂 But I really do try! Never seems to work apparently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I was absent in Creative Writing and didn&amp;rsquo;t hear about the 5 journals we had to write. I figure I&amp;rsquo;ll write a few things about the break and use them as the 5 entries. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably do that at the end of this email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drab Drab Drab….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very very sick of this semester and I&amp;rsquo;m glad that it&amp;rsquo;s ending soon. I have a TWELVE day break. Sort of. Two of those days, I have exams. But they end early so it&amp;rsquo;s not a huge deal. AND DAMMIT, it was supposed to snow/ice tommorow but it&amp;rsquo;s not going to do that anymore. Just supposed to rain. I&amp;rsquo;m quite annoyed at that, but again TWELVE DAY BREAK. That&amp;rsquo;s like winter vacation all over again!! Without the people home from college and all. And then second semester will start and things will REALLY start to roll. Come to think of it, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll just stick the two journal entries that I&amp;rsquo;ve written this year in my CW journal, and then scribble a couple more in school. I really have to write this essay… but I know I&amp;rsquo;m going to start it at like 9… delay some more and then eventually begin at like 10. It&amp;rsquo;s a very very tough essay to write because you have to analyze every little word, and it&amp;rsquo;s relevance to the theme of the poem, which of course is a paradox. The paradox is that even though things may die, death still represents a cycle, meaning that the dead things will eventually be replaced by living organisms once more, whether it&amp;rsquo;s new leaves on a tree or new people on the earth. Death does not mean a total absence of life… it&amp;rsquo;s a signal of upcoming life. Damn Shakespeare and his insight…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This record I&amp;rsquo;m listening to, is so indescribable. On one hand, there is so much distortion that I can&amp;rsquo;t really concentrate on the actual music. On the other hand, that makes it more fun. And the inner layer of music is absolutely gorgeous. The lead singer of MBV sings very well, without having the best voice in the entire world. I think the Bob Mould really ripped these guys off. He even used a lyric/melody from &lt;em&gt;blown a wish&lt;/em&gt; on his song &lt;em&gt;favorite things&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be one of the best indie rock albums ever created… I think Yo La Tengo is generally a better band when it comes to this sorta music… but maybe I haven&amp;rsquo;t been enlightened with MBV yet. It took a while for YLT… maybe it&amp;rsquo;ll happen again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wanna go to the vaco show, but I&amp;rsquo;m too lazy to buy a ticket. That, and I&amp;rsquo;m feeling guilty about my parents having to pay so much money for me. BUT, the cool thing is that I got a credit card/atm card today. It works like a check and I can use it as a credit card at any place that accepts Visa. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty genius. Of course there&amp;rsquo;s no money in it. When I get paid though, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna make a deposit and then watch my money grow. Except it won&amp;rsquo;t grow at all. Even though my dad is convinced that it will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startin to feel the pangs of hunger. Dinner won&amp;rsquo;t be ready till Dad gets home, but who knows when that&amp;rsquo;s gonna be. OH and I forgot, it&amp;rsquo;s Thursday! That means a new Friends tonight. Great, even more distractions from my Sonnet 73 essay. I had to read that sonnet out loud in front of the entire class. Somehow, they all got it, she had no problem with the way that everyone else read it. Me, of course, she wanted full emotion and flow. Everyone else she settled for line breaks in their reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come to think of it MBV is incredible. I heard a live MP3 of them a couple days ago and it was terrible. They tried to do the same hushed vocals live, except the vocals were WAY too soft, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t even enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to shave. Hard for people to believe, but I&amp;rsquo;ve JUST started having the need to shave everyday. That, and any sort of stubble at all looks really bad with long hair. I need to start waking up and meditating more. In the evening, I&amp;rsquo;m way too tired to meditate. I always end up almost falling asleep and then quitting. And that&amp;rsquo;s a horrible way to meditate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank God for computers. If it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for computers, I&amp;rsquo;d still be on the first paragraph of this journal entry, and I woudln&amp;rsquo;t remember any of the thoughts that after that. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with the fact that I can almost type as fast as I think. Almost. But then my fingers get tired. I don&amp;rsquo;t mind though, I &amp;rsquo;m getting flow again and it&amp;rsquo;s really nice. I can finally write without feeling forced. It&amp;rsquo;s a GREAT feeling. If I had to log into LJ through the web, I&amp;rsquo;d probably never do it. This LJ program is the best way to go, I don&amp;rsquo;t even have to open my browser. I really dig it, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for something like it for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to go play Metroid for a bit. Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll write some more later on this entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10:08 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazing! Dad actually was understanding when it came to me being stressed out. Mom is kinda being understanding too. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11:45 p.m&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished my essay. Good lord. It&amp;rsquo;s almost 3 pages… I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I did that. Still leaves my creative writing journals to do, my math homework, and my theory work. I&amp;rsquo;m in college but I&amp;rsquo;m still floundering 🙁&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main cause of me doing my essay so late was the fact that Election was on TV and it really got me interested. A dark comedy, but it just reconfirmed the fact that Matthew Broderick is the man. Anyway, this essay&amp;rsquo;s a buncha BS, but I&amp;rsquo;m kinda happy I finished it. Now I can go to sleep and wake up happy. Hopefully she won&amp;rsquo;t check homework, although I know she will. I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to help tape something for period 1 internship… maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get out of class, that&amp;rsquo;d be nice. But ya know what? Tommorow&amp;rsquo;s Friday!! Friday is the best day, I&amp;rsquo;ll get to see Covin before he leaves, and Saturday I get to see Christine….. that makes me hap hap happy. Well that&amp;rsquo;s it for now, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna go to sleep…&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I swear that I&amp;rsquo;m bi polar. It just happens, I&amp;rsquo;ll be in the best mood and all of a sudden it gets deflated. I start listening to depressing music, writing really depressing songs, and … writing in my live journal 🙂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone should buy the new Wilco album. It&amp;rsquo;s just so perfectly raw. The music is just beautiful and jeff tweedy&amp;rsquo;s lyrics are perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to me sinking. I dunno, I was so high… so high up. And then about 20 mins ago, boom, back down to the ground. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been here for a while, it&amp;rsquo;s disgusting. honestly, no events triggered it, it was like I&amp;rsquo;m here and then I&amp;rsquo;m there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;People that can tell each other anything. That&amp;rsquo;s probably bullshit cuz I just don&amp;rsquo;t see how you could come out with your feelings to someone. especially if they&amp;rsquo;re as twisted up as mine are. I guess I feel as if writing about it is gonna make it feel better, and it will. Posting it publicly shows that i don&amp;rsquo;t really mind if people read it. In fact, I hope people read it. The question is, are they caring about it or not? I feel as if i&amp;rsquo;m the only one who care about it. Removing the comment feature is a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My life right now IS this wilco album. Like, just the way that it feels. Slow, moody, and in anticipation. Of what? Summer, I think it&amp;rsquo;s most definetely summer. I want summer to come so quickly. And because of that it won&amp;rsquo;t come quickly at all. What exams do i have to do well in. Let&amp;rsquo;s see. Calc I can fuck up all I want as long as I pass 4th quarter. English i&amp;rsquo;ve got a B, I&amp;rsquo;ll be fine. Chem I&amp;rsquo;ve got a C, i&amp;rsquo;ll be fine. Ap world…. it all depends on 4th quarter. I gotta get a B. if I get a B, life will be good.&lt;br&gt;
Hey if you&amp;rsquo;re readin this, anyone, talk to me. I wanna know how you are, if in return you truly wanna know how I am. If we can both vibe and feel each other then I think things&amp;rsquo;ll be alright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something wrong with me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow. It amazes me how crazy everybody is. People give people credit for the craziest shit sometimes. Individualism baby, that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m talkin about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep forgetting to get rid of the comment feature on my entries. And then when I get all these posts about shit, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but read em. I&amp;rsquo;m always nervous some insecure asshole&amp;rsquo;s gonna type shit to me cuz they dont like me or something. And then I&amp;rsquo;m gonna be thinkin about it forever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m so mad… I got my nyc pictures back, I took too many of the same thing. Like 4 of the workshop, and they didn&amp;rsquo;t even turn out well, just cuz of the lighting. and fuckin 20 bucks. WHAT THE HELL!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The howie/matt show was SO awesome. Howie should change his beats sometimes, make em a little faster. Every beat he does is the same. Matt Nathanson on the other hand… WHAT AN AWESOME GUY. I really hope he makes it. REALLY. Howie&amp;rsquo;s on the path already, signed to Epic, but matt&amp;rsquo;s still stuck on Acrobatic… maybe he likes the freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m listening to Carbon Leaf&amp;rsquo;s latest right now. They&amp;rsquo;re a fuckin awesome band with a lotta celtic influences. They do a cover of Mary Mac, it&amp;rsquo;s awesome. And Dave Matthews&amp;rsquo; keyboardist plays on a few of their tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s there to say? I&amp;rsquo;m havin fun right now. Enjoying life cuz the show is over, and I passed my algebra test, I&amp;rsquo;m finally gonna do a pass/fail in calculus. My math teacher is really cool. In class she&amp;rsquo;s normal, outta class she&amp;rsquo;s a really nice woman though. Good thing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AHHHH summer is soooo close. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait, these next few weeks are gonna pass by like *snap*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom just walked in and told me that I&amp;rsquo;m very forgiving and easy going and she likes that about me. I like that too! hah. SHe said &amp;ldquo;life&amp;rsquo;s too short to hold grudges against people.&amp;rdquo; and I thought that was cool… since my mom usually doesn&amp;rsquo;t follow that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, happy mo&amp;rsquo;s day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Z&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just want to let every one know that if you really are a music enthusiast, you should buy Koss TD-80 headphones. I was in georgetown with sarah anne and christine and I bought em and they are just amazing. The normal headphones has like 15-30 Ohms, this has 60 ohms… the highest frequency it picks up is 20,000 hz and the lowest is 17,000 hz. This thing is true hardcore. It&amp;rsquo;s been a very long day… I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I actually made it through it. Some people just make things more bearable I guess.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Discs to check out:&lt;br&gt;
David Mead – Mine and Yours&lt;br&gt;
I don&amp;rsquo;t care what anyone says, this guy writes incredible songs. Not half as good live, but he is such a great songwriter. Like, everything fits together so perfectly and you wonder how he thought of such great songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goo Goo Dolls – Gutterflower&lt;br&gt;
Just something to check out. It hasn&amp;rsquo;t fully grown on me yet. It has a really nice sound though, probably not as good as Dizzy though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screaming Headless Torsos-&lt;br&gt;
JUST CAUSE. They rock hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show is good. Holy shit, it&amp;rsquo;s good. Opening night for me is going to be better than any opening night I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had… HARDCORE MOTHAFUCKA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LIFE IS GOOD YALL…&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have tried to write an entry for the past few weeks or so and I just could never finish. It is always late nights like this where I say, I just can&amp;rsquo;t write an entry, I&amp;rsquo;m too tired. And ya know it shoudln&amp;rsquo;t matter if I don&amp;rsquo;t write an entry. After all, I&amp;rsquo;m out enjoying life instead of in my room at the computer writing entries that about 4 people are going to read. But no matter. I want this to be a journal that people will feel happy to read.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I want this to be a journal that people will feel happy to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I went to the mall with nick, annie, fallon, and her brother robert. it was really fun and i dug it lots. Also, over spring break I recorded a new version of the song &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t Breathe&amp;rdquo; and it sounds pretty good. I&amp;rsquo;m sorta satisfied for once. ANd i&amp;rsquo;ve even given it a couple days to sink in… still sounding aight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well there are about a billion things going on in my life right now that are good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#1! I passed my geometry exam, and in short that means a rise in my GPA. A whole lot. The future is looking bright mofo!&lt;br&gt;
#2! It is fucking spring break, and so far it has been the best spring break of my life.&lt;br&gt;
#3! I saw VaCo last night and I&amp;rsquo;m seeing DMB on the 4th. First dmb concert ever.&lt;br&gt;
#4! I got to chill with blaemire for at least a little while, and that&amp;rsquo;s always fun.&lt;br&gt;
#5! I am getting so much new music. New bands that everyone should check out : KINGS OF CONVENIENCE (these guys are acoustic BLISS), Actual Tigers (fun pop), Ryan Adams (his record GOLD… words cannot express), phantom planet (fun pop again).&lt;br&gt;
#6! All of my friend&amp;rsquo;s girlfriends are occupied with beach activities or other things, so i get em all to myself. Not to be selfish or anything but my friends are the greatest.&lt;br&gt;
#7! Spring weather brings better moods.&lt;br&gt;
#8! Imagine putting together the excitement from #&amp;rsquo;s 1-7, wrapping them into a ball and spreading it out into a female companion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazingly enough we haven&amp;rsquo;t had a single day off due to snow this year. Now it&amp;rsquo;s spring and it&amp;rsquo;s not going to snow… but for some reason, I don&amp;rsquo;t mind 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I suppose a journal is supposed to be one of those Dear Me, Truly Yours sorts thangs. Ya know, stuff that doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve other people. Somehow I can&amp;rsquo;t bring myself to get very personal. I mean I get personal, but not to the point at whcih I am saying names and people and stuff and junk and that sort of etc. etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So let me break the pace here and do a Dear You, Truly Yours sorta thang. The people that leave comments. Some of you guys are really truly nice and make me feel really good sometimes. I always forget to remove the comment feature. I usually get scared that someone will post something like &amp;ldquo;Get over yourself mofo.&amp;rdquo; Well if they ever do, FUCK YOU! Don&amp;rsquo;t read my journal! Oh one more thing, please please please, don&amp;rsquo;t leave comments anonymously. I love to know who&amp;rsquo;s saying what. Honestly it makes me feel better. You guys think your being all slick, but really your just causing my brain to hurt trying to figure out who is saying what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the Dear Me thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My birthday had a flaw, we could say. To make a short story even shorter and more scrambled, there is no snow coming our way, never will be snow coming our way, in fact as far as we are concerned it is going to be July for the rest of our fucking lives. thank you weatherman, for real. you don&amp;rsquo;t know the doors you&amp;rsquo;ve opened. Really! However – it is snowing in Zimbabwe, hardcore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I angry about not getting the long awaited snow? Oh please, let&amp;rsquo;s not put me there, shall we. that&amp;rsquo;s all mother nature&amp;rsquo;s doing, and gosh I don&amp;rsquo;t tell her what the fuck to do, ya know? she don&amp;rsquo;t tell me what to do, and I don&amp;rsquo;t give her orders either. besides I kinda like the sunshine. But you know, there&amp;rsquo;s something about that snow that makes a year complete. If I lived in Florida, I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I would do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should&amp;rsquo;ve known, after all, the groundhog didn&amp;rsquo;t see his shadow now did he? does the groundhog ever see his shadow? is the groundhog a white supremist? when they test out to see if he is seeing his shadow, do they put him in a shadowy area, and consider those shadows to be a shadow? Or since there would be no actual shadow from the groundhog himself (itself?) do they just assume there is no shadow. They should use a tortoise instead. I hear those are easy to take care of, and you can keep multiple tortoises on a roof of a large building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update on the calc shit. I have to take a geometry final, and then I&amp;rsquo;ll be off the hook, I can pass/fail calc. (they gave me a 30 page review packet) For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know what that means, it basically means if I pass the course, I get credit, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t get mixed into my gpa, and the colleges never see what grade i got, just that I passed. Great system eh. Oh, and a great thing happened today. Interims came and I have a B in technology. This is disgusting. I consider myself to be pretty technological. I can write in HTML, and I can solve the so called &amp;ldquo;viruses&amp;rdquo; that people think are in their computers. But I can&amp;rsquo;t get a car to run down the hall. DEEEZgusting. Can&amp;rsquo;t stand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get my microphone back, so many new ideas, so many corrections on old shit. New recording of shannon is coming up. What a crappy crappy crappy song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing. On the Geometry review packet, there is a section completely dedicated to quadrilaterals. Could throw up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not that I don&amp;rsquo;t like the fact that MY quadrilateral is made out of vectors instead of regular lines. It&amp;rsquo;s the fact that line AB exists. BC exists. CD even exists. DA? nope. Point A is a lonely place to be. Makes you go nuts thinking about it, and it is worse than geometry. Now, if the dervitate of Point A is equal to the rate at which the blood is drained from Point A&amp;rsquo;s heart, what is dX/dY ( the rate at which tears fall onto an off white pillow)? And what is the temperature of the tears, in Celsius degrees. How many moles does each tear contain, and what would each tear&amp;rsquo;s electron dot diagram look like. Ionic or covalent? Polar? They say if the tear has a higher electronegativity, more emotion was put into the creation of the tear. Fluorine, eat your heart out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To everyone I&amp;rsquo;ve had a depthful conversation with today – I love you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just stand there, and stick your glove out in the air. I&amp;rsquo;ll take care of the rest.&amp;rdquo; – Benny, from the Sandlot&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I woke up and just like in the past years, I completely forgot that it was my birthday. My sister woke me up with a loud happy birthday, and then my parents followed. But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t singing. Weird, they didn&amp;rsquo;t sing to me this year. I dunno why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s freezing outside and also freezing inside my house. I&amp;rsquo;m sitting here listening to this record I bought by a band called South, and folks, they are incredible. I really think it&amp;rsquo;s the best album of the year (so far). It&amp;rsquo;s only March, but I mean I really don&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s going to beat this. Last year my album of the year was Duncan Sheik&amp;rsquo;s Phantom Moon. Seriously phenomenal. But so far this year, South has really got me. Amazing production, and the band is really growing on me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Today was a great birthday, despite the pain in my neck and arm. I think I slept on something wrong or something. And everytime I cough now, my chest burns. I think just need tommorow to chill at home and read huck finn, study, and other things. It&amp;rsquo;ll be a good day, I don&amp;rsquo;t even have rehersal tommorow. It&amp;rsquo;ll be fantastic. Ugh, I&amp;rsquo;m lookin forward to it already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like writing much more, so I&amp;rsquo;m gonna take a shower and sleep. Gnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you really wanna see me check the paper or the tv…&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;here&amp;rsquo;s some stuff I found.&lt;br&gt;
On a Sear&amp;rsquo;s hairdryer:&lt;br&gt;
Do not use while sleeping.&lt;br&gt;
darn, and that&amp;rsquo;s the only time I have to work on my hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a bag of Fritos:&lt;br&gt;
You could be a winner! No purchase necessary. Details in side.&lt;br&gt;
the shoplifter special?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a bar of Dial soap:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Directions: Use like regular soap.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
and that would be how….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On some Swanson frozen dinners:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Serving suggestion: Defrost.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
but, it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; a suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;On Tesco&amp;rsquo;s Tiramisu dessert (printed on bottom):&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Do not turn upside down.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
well…duh, a bit late, huh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Marks &amp;amp; Spencer Bread Pudding:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Product will be hot after heating.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
…and you thought?…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On packaging for a Rowenta iron:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Do not iron clothes on body.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
but wouldn&amp;rsquo;t this save me more time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Boot&amp;rsquo;s Children Cough Medicine:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Do not drive a car or operate machinery after taking this medication.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
We could do a lot to reduce the rate of construction accidents if we could just&lt;br&gt;
get those 5-year-olds with head-colds off those forklifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Nytol Sleep Aid:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Warning: May cause drowsiness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
and…I&amp;rsquo;m taking this because….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On most brands of Christmas lights:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;For indoor or outdoor use only.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
as opposed to…what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a Japanese food processor:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Not to be used for the other use.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
now, somebody out there, help me on this. I&amp;rsquo;m a bit curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sainsbury&amp;rsquo;s peanuts:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Warning: contains nuts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
talk about a news flash&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On an American Airlines packet of nuts:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Instructions: Open packet, eat nuts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
Step 3: maybe, uh…fly Delta?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a child&amp;rsquo;s superman costume:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Wearing of this garment does not enable you to fly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
I don&amp;rsquo;t blame the company. I blame the parents for this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a Swedish chainsaw:&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Do not attempt to stop chain with your hands or genitals.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
Oh my God…was there a lot of this happening somewhere?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yucking someone’s yum” could be defined as being overly negative about something that someone else is fond of, in front of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve yucked people’s yum before without realizing it. Especially when it comes to pro sports, which I don’t think I’ll ever fully understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know better now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yucking the yum is the type of activity that can cause long-term shame (of the yummer) in exchange for short-term satisfaction (of the yucker).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Yucking the yum is the type of activity that can cause long-term shame (of the yummer) in exchange for short-term satisfaction (of the yucker).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This occurred to me when someone once described listening to pop music as a “guilty pleasure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes you wonder: outside of morally objectionable activities, why would someone feel guilty about doing something pleasurable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you can’t come up with a reason, we could conclude that &lt;em&gt;most pleasure is innocent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the person who feels shame over liking pop music. At some point, that person’s yum was yucked. Yucking the yum is like stealing a piece of someone’s joy. It erodes the soul and quiets the voice. And if you engage in this sort of activity, you’re a joy thief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need an alternative, try the phrase “It’s just not for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve yucked people’s yum before without realizing it. Especially when it comes to pro sports, which I don’t think I’ll ever fully understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know better now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yucking the yum is the type of activity that can cause long-term shame (of the yummer) in exchange for short-term satisfaction (of the yucker).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This occurred to me when someone once described listening to pop music as a “guilty pleasure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes you wonder: outside of morally objectionable activities, why would someone feel guilty about doing something pleasurable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you can’t come up with a reason, we could conclude that &lt;em&gt;most pleasure is innocent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the person who feels shame over liking pop music. At some point, that person’s yum was yucked. Yucking the yum is like stealing a piece of someone’s joy. It erodes the soul and quiets the voice. And if you engage in this sort of activity, you’re a joy thief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need an alternative, try the phrase “It’s just not for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
