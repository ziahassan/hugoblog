I was talking with a friend about whether or not we’re “weird.” And I’m sure many people have described me as weird, but those are the people that don’t really connect to me. They aren’t concerned with what I’m concerned about.

After all, I’m the type of person that could fall down the YouTube rabbit hole on the most random subjects, I could learn the ins and outs of microphones or tennis balls or what is the nicest pencil. I could discover the end of the rainbow if I tried, I really could.

And the people who don’t get that will probably find me strange, or weird. And that’s okay.

I’d rather easily repel those who don’t get me, and strongly attract those who do, instead of wanting to seem “cool” to everyone.
