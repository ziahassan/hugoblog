I just want to let every one know that if you really are a music enthusiast, you should buy Koss TD-80 headphones. I was in georgetown with sarah anne and christine and I bought em and they are just amazing. The normal headphones has like 15-30 Ohms, this has 60 ohms&#8230; the highest frequency it picks up is 20,000 hz and the lowest is 17,000 hz. This thing is true hardcore. It's been a very long day&#8230; I can't believe I actually made it through it. Some people just make things more bearable I guess.

Discs to check out:  
David Mead &#8211; Mine and Yours  
I don't care what anyone says, this guy writes incredible songs. Not half as good live, but he is such a great songwriter. Like, everything fits together so perfectly and you wonder how he thought of such great songs.

Goo Goo Dolls &#8211; Gutterflower  
Just something to check out. It hasn't fully grown on me yet. It has a really nice sound though, probably not as good as Dizzy though.

Screaming Headless Torsos-  
JUST CAUSE. They rock hard.

The show is good. Holy shit, it's good. Opening night for me is going to be better than any opening night I've ever had&#8230; HARDCORE MOTHAFUCKA

LIFE IS GOOD YALL&#8230;
