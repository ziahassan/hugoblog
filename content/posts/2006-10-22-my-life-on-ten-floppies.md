I&#8217;ve always had this weird obsession with robots and artificial intelligence. I would scour the internet looking for new apps that could respond to what I&#8217;m saying with some shred of intelligence and I would try to write programs that would seem intelligent. The biggest thrill of my life came from a program I wrote (in Basic) that would ask you for your name, and then spit it back to you in the form of some salutation. It wasn&#8217;t artificially intelligent, but it was a huge success with my other geek-friends, who I gave copies to on a 3.5 floppy.  
Eight years later, I&#8217;m still a technology geek, but I&#8217;m not amazed by the little improvements anymore. A search I run in Google will be analyzed and I will be offered relevant marketing messages, Gmail knows who I frequently write mail to, and the internet tailors itself to my needs and preferences. It&#8217;s too bad that my little 3kb program won&#8217;t even run anymore on a platform beyond Win98 without the user having to manually open a command line.

I&#8217;ve been having this feeling lately: I&#8217;ve forgotten something. That state where you can&#8217;t remember what you&#8217;re supposed to be remembering. Maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve been doing a better job of capturing everything lately, and it almost seems like a trap. Or I really am forgetting something or someone.
