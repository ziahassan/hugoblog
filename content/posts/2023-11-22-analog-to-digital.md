I've been thinking deeply about the way in which I use digital and analog tools.

Having recently picked up the Kindle Scribe, I've become interested (again) in the power of handwriting. 

One core realization of the digital/analog divide seems to be that:

1. Digital tools are useful for efficiency;
2. Analog tools (notebooks, pens, etc) are useful for thinking and focus

So, a tool like Obsidian is useful in that it allows me to really plan my year, my quarterly goals, etc. It allows me to write documents efficiently with markdown. And for things I will either need again, or that I would like to resurface at some point, there's nothing like it. 

A tool like Ominfocus is great at being the "bank" as David Sparks calls it. I will not lose track of _anything_ if it is store in Omnifocus... AND the perspectives I can create are endless.

You can't query a notebook.

But for daily plans, weekly spreads, future logs, collections, etc. I'm starting to think that something like the Bullet Journal may be the best way to go.

Together, the Bullet Journal and something like Obsidian (and perhaps a robust task manager such as Omnifocus or Todoist or Things3) could bring order to chaos.
