_Mary, Mary, quite contrary, how does your garden grow?_

A garden and a gym are both opportunities for growth. In a gym, it’s the gym-goers duty to lift heavier or run faster/farther than they did the week before. In a garden, it’s a plant’s job to grow, and it’s the gardener’s job to create the conditions necessary for that growth to occur.

So it’s quite contrary how gardens grow. They don’t. The plants grow, but only as a function of the attention of the gardener to details.
