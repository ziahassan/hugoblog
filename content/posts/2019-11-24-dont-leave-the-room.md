Another alternative meditation technique is as follows.

Enter the meditation room, close the door, and don’t open it again for the next 20 minutes. You must stay in this space.

But physically staying in a space is somewhat easy. We could read or watch TV in the same room for hours and hours. Staying inside of a space metaphysically is the hard part.

When I’m driving, I stay physically in the cars for hours sometimes. But metaphysically, I’m all over the place. I’ve left the car and I’m revisiting a memory from 2002. Or perhaps I’ve traveled into the future and I’m experiencing what Thanksgiving dinner will be like (in my imagination).

When we stay in a room, both physically and spiritually, the room becomes the universe.
