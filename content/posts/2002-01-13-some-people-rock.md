My friend and I both started our journals at the same time, and she wrote this really nice entry about me. I'm not sure exactly why, but it sure was cool. it takes mariam to do something like that ðŸ™‚

see i always have the ambition to do something nice like that for someone. but i'd be afraid of not knowing what to say. like, I could say&#8230; this person is nice, cool, the best ever&#8230; etc. But if I were the person being talked about, I'd never believe myself.

"the faster you go, the slower you grow, the less that you have to fall. until you weigh nothing at all."

check out the album Quick by Eddie From Ohio. they really are phenomenal. I usually don't like country, and I usually don't love female vocalists. seriously not a sexist thing, I just don't usually enjoy it as much. Maybe it is cuz i can't relate to a female becuase i'm not a female. but eddie from ohio, it's just so perfectly done, so well done, god damn.

back to being nice to people. what mariam said was totally right, people need to say some good things about people once in a while. and it's not like I doubt any nice thing anyone says about me. they might feel that way, I just don't agree with them, and I don't see it in myself.

I'm gettin back into the love thing. I stopped for a while, and now i'm falling in love with everyone and everything. It's a really weird feeling, loving but getting no love back. It's like when you get those muscular pains and you hit yourself. And like, your hitting yourself but it feels good.

I'm listenin to miles davis' bitches brew right now. man this is some CRAZY SHIT. you think radio head is out there? listen to this record, it makes radiohead look non-original. I dunno what to make of it. It's not jazz, it's not rock. It's classifed as "fusion." It's just a weird&#8230; weird &#8230; weird album. But so fuckin cool at the same time.

I used to go to bed so early, now it's like 12 every night. Yeah 12, ain't a big deal for some of you. But like freshman year i would go to bed at like 10:30. now that was great. i'd wake up feeling good. man and i have a freakin audition tommorow  
i know i'm gonna forget my song or something. GODAMMIT, I can't find the first sheet to it.

ugh. baja fresh is good but gives mad stomach achage.
