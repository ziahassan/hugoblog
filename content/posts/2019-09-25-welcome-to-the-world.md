How we welcome new people to the world is important. After all, we were once greeted for the first time and how it happened mattered.

The first thing I did with my son when we arrived home from the hospital was giving him a tour of his house. 

I showed him the bedrooms, bathrooms, the cool lights in the living room, and the hidden crawl space in the laundry room. 

I don&#8217;t know if he&#8217;ll ever remember it, or if he was even awake for it. All I know is that&#8217;s how I&#8217;d want to enter the world (at least, post-hospital). With an orientation, a sense of home, a map of the place you always return to.
