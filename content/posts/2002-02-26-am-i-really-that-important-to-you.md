'm back mothafucka.  
but this is my own journal. what does being back really mean? i've still been thinkin, stlill been keepin my thoughts flowin like a river. not a lake mind you. lakes don't flow, they just kinda sit there, and people paddle in them. that's YOU. you are the lake. or the paddlers rather. and there waint' no water so you were screamin to me from being at the bottom of a big hole of dried up mud.

I swear to god, does it really matter that much if I don't update my journal? For your information I have been updating it, with private entries. that you'll never read HAHAHAHAA. I have complete control over you. You look at my journal everyday in the hopes of something new, but it never comes! NEVER! NEVAH!!! HAHAHA&#8230;

Back to me. Cuz that's what this journal is about anyway. A time for me to be self centered. Although some might say, that's all the time ðŸ™‚ I hope not though.

They played john mayer on DC101. Not only that he is on the It's Your Fault countdown. This is SUCH a big deal. He is going to be so big. Everyone is pisssed about his success. Like all the old school fans and stuff. I'm just&#8230; I dunno yet. Once he gets there I will know for sure how I feel about it. But like, I tell everyone I can about John&#8230; becuase I want everyone to hear him. And now they will. They really will. Good lord.

So I ate wendy's today for lunch, and mcdonald's for dinner. I'm becoming humongous. You people don't notice (Or maybe you do) but I am becoming a big big big big guy. In a bad way though. Not the football player muscle way. Like, the&#8230; brown tennis player guy way. Too much curry?

I'm listening to Room For Squares. It seriously will never get old. Its such a solid album. Laura doesn't think Neon is radio friendly. I could not disagree more. Girl don't know what she's talkin about. But oh she's just so sweet that I have to give in &#8230; fine. neon is not radio frieldly. erm. yeah.

I remember the first time I heard Room For Squares. It really was a magical experience. It's so beautiful and well done at the same. I think it is almost becoming one of my favorite albums ever. Along with Ducan Sheik's phantom moon&#8230; the only thing I have to complain about is the fuckin bad mix of YBIAW. I like it much better on the old RFS. There's this weird lil organ thing above everything and it's so annoying.

So here's what's goin on. I'm failin calc&#8230; badly. 50% or somethin like that. I'm gonna either try to drop it or do pass/fail. If I can't do either, my parents are gonna make me drop out of brigadoon. I don't want to do that but I'll have to&#8230; it's for my own good. I really don't want to though. REALLY REALLY. i'm havin fun. brodsky rocks. the cast rocks. stones rock.

7:25 is SUCH a bad time to have calculus. I wish I could talk to an adult and they'd just be like "yeah i know what you mean, that is riddiculous." Cuz it is, you fuckin know it is. Myabe it if was later, it'd be a little more bearable. No, first thing in the morning. Fuck me&#8230;. gotta make up a chem lab too. But I gots rehersal. luckily brodsky said it was ok if I missed a little bit of rehersal thursday. what a fuckin good guy. I really dig him, dig his way of working. if you read this mr brodsky, i'm sucking up, please re-cast me as a lead.

sarcasm yall.

Lately I can't stop thinkin about shannon. I don't know why. I think I'm gonna call her. Havne't talked to her for SOOOO long though. It's crazy. It'd be fuckin weird to talk to her, but also awesome at the same time, ya know.

Well anyway thank you for reading this&#8230; I don't know why you like reading it. But maybe it keeps you entertained. It sure is something for me to do. Christine and Laura i hope you are happy, this entry was for you.

\*gasp\* that's MY plastic in the dirt!!
