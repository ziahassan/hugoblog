I often see social media posts (or sometimes real life examples) of a thing where parents put their kids into outfits that act as bumper stickers.

Whether it's a political orientation, or perhaps a sports team, I question the ethics.

A child, especially a toddler or infant, is too young to have associations with political candidates or sports teams, even if those candidates and teams come from the child's hometown.

So, then, is this practice ethical?

On one hand, there's very little outward harm caused by it. The child isn't necessarily being _forced_ into fandom or loyalty.

However, I wonder if this sort of practice is really just a symptom of a deeper phenomenon: we want our kids to be a certain way. We have expectations for them right out of the womb, like "I hope he's a soccer player" or "she's gonna be such a heartbreaker!"

Most of this is mindless; I do not believe that parents actively set out to condition their children. 

But it makes me think there is perhaps a need to look within as parents. To see the ways in which we influence our children and make a judgment call about balance.
