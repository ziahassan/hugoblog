We don't build in time to process life events.

I think [[holidays]] are the ancient way of doing this. 

Christmas break is often a time to stop and think. New Years resolutions perhaps too.

But a process to process might mean a weekly/montly moment that isn't tied to a specific event, to sit down and get [[coaching]] or do some [[scoaching]].

Sample questions:
- What emotional items need processing?
- What have I been avoiding?
- What do I need more of?
- What do I need less of?
- What do I need?
