Some of my cousins live far away, so when it was the first time we&#8217;d seen each other in a while, there was always a bit of awkwardness. A moment or two of shyness, of hiding behind our parents legs&#8230; and then we&#8217;d participate in some activity that was really more like parallel play, and after that&#8230; pure bliss, as we discovered that, despite being a few years older than the last time, we were pretty much the same and could pick up exactly where we left off.

Last night, I was with some friends from middle school. I hadn&#8217;t seen these friends in nearly 20 years (we went to an international school in Cairo, Egypt).

&#8220;This one friend,&#8221; I told my wife on the way there, &#8220;is super goofy. Though, then again, that was when she was twelve. I guess people probably change.&#8221;

Well, it turns out she&#8217;s still silly. And all of the friends that I reconnected were almost exactly as I remember them (with a little more gray hair, and children). People change less than I thought. And relationships with those with whom we&#8217;ve had vivid and life-lasting memories&#8230; we pick up right where we left off.

I brought a deck of cards with me. I figured that no one would remember that I constantly did magic when I was 13 as a way to make friends, but that if I didn&#8217;t bring a deck along with me, I&#8217;d be mad if there was a missed opportunity to perform (performance is a [gift][1]). It was one of the first things that someone asked me about.

&#8220;So you&#8217;ve been doing magic all this time?&#8221; someone asked.

&#8220;I&#8217;ve gone in and out of it,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;I got self conscious at times. When you&#8217;re a kid and you think magic is the coolest thing ever, it doesn&#8217;t really occur to you that most of the world sees it as a pretty nerdy hobby.&#8221;

My friend interrupted me and wildly exclaimed &#8220;you&#8217;ve got to own it! Be yourself!&#8221;

It was so blatant and obvious that made me stop in my tracks.

I&#8217;ve grappled with being myself for my entire life, as many people have. But the way that this friend put it, with such matter-of-factness (nearly frustration), it flipped my mind.

Obviously, being yourself is the path of least resistance. And yet, we resist. But then we meet someone, someone we haven&#8217;t seen for a while, someone who knew us an insecure 13 year old trying to grapple with life&#8217;s mysteries&#8230; and although we&#8217;re now a grown-up, they still see that kid they knew. The one that sang for fun, made up songs, found your selected card, and goofed off in geography class. And they remind us: &#8220;I see you. I accept you. I love you the way you are. I love who you are. Now do me a huge favor&#8230;

Own it.&#8221;
