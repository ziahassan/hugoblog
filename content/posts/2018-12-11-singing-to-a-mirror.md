Songwriting is reflective by its very nature. Writing lyrics is a kind of therapy, of course. But how those lyrics are presented, the texture of the music, the sentiment of the chord changes, the choice of instruments&#8230; all of these artistic choices are part of a reflective process.

Because when artists look inward, we&#8217;re sometimes confronted with stuff we&#8217;d rather not acknowledge. Other times, it&#8217;s stuff we were actually searching for, like an understanding of why we feel what we feel.

And other times we write about stuff that hasn&#8217;t happened yet. It&#8217;s a phenomenon that always baffles me, but I sometimes write a song that sounds and looks great but has no connection to my life until a few months later, when something happens and the song suddenly makes total sense. It&#8217;s a type of clairvoyance that I&#8217;ve never experienced outside of writing music.

I upped my game quite a bit when I moved into an apartment with a huge bathroom back in 2011. Huge bathrooms mean great acoustics, so it was the perfect place to sing and record ideas into my phone. But along with a huge bathroom came a huge mirror. And suddenly I could see myself as I was generating ideas.

And weirdly, it helped.

My face and body language, I discovered, are incredible feedback machines. Generally, if I write in front of a mirror I make a better song. I can&#8217;t pin point the exact moment where the mirror helps me make good musical choices, but I can feel it.

I sing words, and my face tells me which word needs to change as I sing it. My reflection is unsure, like trying a new food for the first time.

When the song can&#8217;t be improved, my reflection is confident, overjoyed even. Like being wrapped in a blanket.

I learn more and more about what it means to reflect every time I pick up an instrument or sing.

But it was a literal mirror that taught me the most.
