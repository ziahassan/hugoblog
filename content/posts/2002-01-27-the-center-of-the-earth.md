Let me tell you how the center of the earth feels. It feels like ice and fire at the same time, like mother nature is smiling on you but every single god is cursing you. It feels like you've won the lottery but lost the ambition to buy anything. Or, bought a car but have nowhere to drive to. A nice car.

If you know what I'm talking about, you're at the center of the earth.

So I haven't written an entry in a while, and I thought this sunday morning was a reasonable time to. Cuz sundays are, well, lazy. No one really gets up to do anything. I mean if we had school tommorow, everyone in the house would be preparing for that. My mom would be makin lunches, my sister would be doing homework, I would be on the computer pretending to do homework, writing music etc.

I feel really bad for my mom. See, my grandmother is staying with us at the moment; she came back from pakistan. And it's like constant torture for my mom, cuz my dad is usually at work, so she has to cater to my grandmother's every need. And she's always in my room, complaining about how much her life sucks since my grandmother is staying with us. And I feel bad cuz no advice I offer her makes a bit of difference. She can't be rude to my grandmother, cuz it's my dad's dad. If it was her own mother, there'd be a difference. And my dad of course, is oblivious to the whole thing.

How come my printer is always out of paper? every single time I go to print something, well&#8230; there's no paper. But I always fill it up ahead of time. It's so frustrating.

Jon told me about this new band called Dakota Moon. They're great, an RnB singer with a rock band. Sorta like Blessid Union of Souls but not as cheesy. not that buos is a cheesy band. But some of their lyrics are like cheeetooosssss.

I went bowling with some of my friends last night. For some reason I felt really good about life at the time. Whoever said life lacks background music was right. For some reason, when cosmic bowling happened at 10 and all the lights went off and the loud music came on (ryan adams was on their mix&#8230; fuckin a) I felt so good about life at that time. Then the minute I got home it all fell away and I was unhappy again. Maybe it was just becuase I was up so late and it was dark outside. Darkness sometimes does that to you, makes you a little more depressed. Also, I was listening to Nick Drake. That mighta had some influence over my mood.

Feelings are tricky things. They inflate so much that you can see right through them. And whenever they expand that much, they pop and of course, you can't see through a popped feeling. There are so many things I'd like to change about myself. Well first of all, I need to stop biting my damn facial hair. Next, I need to stop being brown. I've been listening to my voice lately, there is quite an accent there. As PJ can attest to. What else. Hmmm&#8230; yeah those damn feelings. Those goddamn feelings.

All I can say is Vanessa Carlton is my hero. Heroine? Heroin? She's just great, this song she's written "Thousand Miles" is just so good. So catchy, and for a pop song she sure has achieved something fantastic. I never thought I'd like pure pop this much.

I'm such a fucking hopeless romantic. I just &#8230; ugh. hello&#8230; help me. Throw me a ball or something.

Maybe if I lost weight, became unbrown, and annunciated more, things would be better for me. And my voice had a soothing quality to it. Boy do things suck. But it's a 5 day weekend, so I guess that's ok.

Does he ever get the girl?
