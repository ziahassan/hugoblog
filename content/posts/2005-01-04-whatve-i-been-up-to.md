Tons of things, man. It&apos;s been beautiful. I&apos;ve been working on linux, writing my album, listening to lots and lots of music, seeing great people. 

New years was sort of a drag. No one&apos;s fault &#8211; it&apos;s just the holiday. It&apos;s getting to be so mundane. But maybe that&apos;s cause I wasn&apos;t home for it.
