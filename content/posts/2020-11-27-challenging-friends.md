Everyone needs a challenging friend or two.

The type of person who is ready to get in your face, break open your perspectives, and put your viewpoints on trial.

Not every friend should be like this. But it’s important to have a few of these kinds of friends on hand and nearby. 

They are your way out of complacency.
