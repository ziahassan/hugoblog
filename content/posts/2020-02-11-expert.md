When someone refers to me as an expert on _anything_, I always do a double take. I get the urge to defend myself and say I’m not an expert in anything. I’m a learner, and I’ll always see myself that way.&nbsp;

Maybe being confident in your decisions is what people refer to when it comes to expert. Not the amount of knowledge you have, but the amount of skill you can apply.
