I like this. So far I&apos;ve had really early shifts, I haven&apos;t taken any naps, I get up at pretty reasonable times without moaning too much, and I spend full days out and about being active. As much fun as lazing around is, when I get into that habit it really fucks up my life. So thankfully, I&apos;m not letting that happen this time.

I think this semester will work perfectly for me. But I also think that when summer gets nearby, I will be ready and willing.
