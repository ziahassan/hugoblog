The best way to make the most of [[coaching]]: do what you say you will do. 

If you spend 30 mins with your coach and you have a ton of breakthroughs and realizations and insights... and then you do *nothing* with those insights, you're wasting time and money. 

As coaches, we can help you see more clearly. We can't do it for you.
