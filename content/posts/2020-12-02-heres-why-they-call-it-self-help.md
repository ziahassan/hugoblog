For some reason, the genre about personal growth and development is labelled as “self help” in book stores.

After all, if you read a self-help book, and it helps you… you didn’t help yourself. It was the book. More specifically, it was the author of the book.

Perhaps it _is_ still appropriate to call it self help: the author helped themselves by synthesizing a solution to their own problem.
