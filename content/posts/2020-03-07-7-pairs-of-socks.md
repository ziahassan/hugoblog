I needed new socks recently so I went to Ross, where I found a set of 7 on sale for $7. When I got home, I realized that each of these pairs was a different color, and each of them had a different day of the week on them.

For a minute, I thought about the possibility of just buying another set and wearing these socks exclusively. It would be a ritual, a way of starting my day. I’d put on the sock that corresponded to the day of the week as a way to greet the morning, to prepare myself for the work of the day, to ground myself.

Kind of like how Steve Jobs wore the same outfit every day to minimize his decision paralysis. Or how I used to wear the same suit for each day of the week when I was a teacher (decision paralysis is particularly paralyzing for teachers).

Of course, what ended up happening is that the pairs got separated and strewn all over the place. I don’t really even try to match them anymore when they’re out of the dryer. Another attempt at structure thwarted by friction.
