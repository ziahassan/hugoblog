If you’ve ever talked to yourself you’ll get it. If you’ve ever patted yourself on the back, or if you’ve ever used harsh words with yourself, you’ll know what I mean.

Self talk is necessarily a dangerous habit because if we convince ourselves that we are as bad or good as we think we are, we might actually believe ourselves. 

Or worse, we might become what we believe ourselves to be, an exaggerated and dehydrated and deflated version of the person we really are.
