One of the greatest pleasures in the world is finding a word or two written in a bathroom stall, or as I once experienced, penned to the railing of the whitewater ride at Six Flags.

A poet can put a couple of line breaks in, recycle a few words, and now this found graffiti can be anything to anyone.
