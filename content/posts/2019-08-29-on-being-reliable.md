Many people make it a goal to be more reliable. To be the kind of person that can be trusted, one that keeps promises. 

How do we practice this? It&#8217;s not as easy as it sounds. 

I find myself more reliable in the last few years than I&#8217;ve ever been before. I can tell because people in my life trust me to complete important projects and tasks. 

But the interesting part is that I haven&#8217;t tried to become a more reliable person to others. Instead, I&#8217;ve been working on _self reliance._ 

I haven&#8217;t been trying to keep promises to others as much as I have been trying to keep promises to myself. And the most essential part of that process is deciding what promises to make to myself. If I constantly think about what promises I&#8217;ve made to everyone else, I end up feeling aimless. 

I cultivate my own values this way and tune into my inner voice. The by product is that I&#8217;m now seen as more reliable to others as an unintended but welcome result.
