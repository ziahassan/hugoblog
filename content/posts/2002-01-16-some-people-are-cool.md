So my parents made me talk to this college counselor/tutor last night. It was mad cool. She's a parent of a kindergartener, so she's reasonably young and she knows her shit. She's been around, college counseling and stuff. Anyway, I asked her what she got on her PSATS/SAT, she said lower than me&#8230; 1000. She had a 4.0 in high school though, she just was a bad test-taker. Then she told me the reason she went into tutoring was to get back at the test for being such a bitch for her. I thought that was so fuckin cool.  
Yeah it's morning. Usually I'm doing homework right about now but I finished my english project. AP world quiz&#8230; but it's open note. Of course I'm gonna fuck it up like normal.

Jess should be here soon. And I gotta eat my pop-tart.

eating it now. it's freezing in the house and I don't know why. actually I do, it's my cuz my dad wants to save money so he doesn't really like turning on the heat. Antartica much dad.

Ya know what pisses me off. I can never fit my lunch into the pocket of my backpack.

I got a new calculator yesterday. It's already broken. I dunno what's wrong with me but I really can't take this. There goes the siren.
