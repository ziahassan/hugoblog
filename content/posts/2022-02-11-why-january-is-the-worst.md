January is the worst month. It’s a slog.

It’s unreasonably cold (relative to your usual weather).

It’s long (31 days).

There’s only one holiday (after a couple of months of many days off).

But then March comes. And at some point, there will be a temporary warming, a little preview of what spring will bring.

And for a moment… all is well.
