I&#8217;ve finally moved into my new home in Letts Hall. It&#8217;s funny to think that I used to live on Northside and work on Southside and now it&#8217;s the exact opposite. Once I stopped working at Weichert, there wasn&#8217;t a specific time of day that I could write in this log, so I stopped unintentionally. Once I find that time in my new job, I can update daily once again.

I&#8217;ve been seeing lots of free movies lately, courtesy of Aimee&#8217;s job at an advertising agency. Miami Vice was one of the better ones, but I wouldn&#8217;t recommend it to someone looking for a good plot. Interested in seeing Little Miss Sunshine, because I want to see Carrell doing something different. I&#8217;ve been reading quite a bit as well. DeBono&#8217;s Thinking Hats is very well thought out, but just like any other new way of thinking, it will be rejected countlessly by organization leaders who have &#8220;always done it this way.&#8221; As for new music, I&#8217;ve been listening to the Silversun Pickups (excellent guitar tones, great writing) and now a band called Maritime. Still sit on my couch and listen to Eno on Vinyl. I almost have all of his rock albums.

Speaking of which, the apartment is one of the most exciting places I&#8217;ve ever been in. Nevermind the fact that I can live for free in a fantastic room with a queen size bed, the shower is one of the most refreshing things I&#8217;ve ever used. The new job has been stressful, but eventful, mainly because of the amounts of red tape I&#8217;ve had to trip over to get things to happen. It&#8217;s always disappointing when someone comes up with a new method which will conserve worker&#8217;s time and energy for more important tasks, and the organization sets up twenty hoops for him to jump through. It&#8217;s also frustrating to spend energy on a project and not know whether or not the product will actually be used.

RA Training begins in a week and Paul comes back as soon as it&#8217;s over. Then, welcome week begins.Â  Mike left for Texas, and we had a nice goodbye party to send him on his way. Old Ebbit&#8217;s Grill &#8211; I ordered the mussels. They were good, but I wish I had gone with the seafood salad. When mealplans don&#8217;t exist, I try to be as extravagant as possible with my dining decisions. Ed and Scott are moving into a new apartment which looks promising.

Plans for today: maybe recording with Andy, getting school-ish supplies, Joe&#8217;s Record Paradise for entertainment music.
