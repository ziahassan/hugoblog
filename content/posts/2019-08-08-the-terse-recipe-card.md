I became a cook in my late 20’s. Someone had given me a card for the company Hello Fresh, which at the time was just starting out with their meal delivery kits. I got a free trial and never looked back. 

Meal delivery took everything I hated out of the cooking process; mostly, going to the [grocery store][1] and measuring things out. After a few years of using the service every week, I felt like I could basically cook anything, even if I didn’t have a great sense of flavor.

I couldn’t help but notice, though, the terse way in which recipes were written.

_Stir the noodles. Drain the pot. Rougly chop_

Compare this to the food bloggers who tell their life story before getting to the recipe. 

But old school recipe cards weren’t made to teach people how to cook; they were meant to jog the memory. A _record_ of something that was once improvisatory art, like documenting the musical notes after you’ve developed the piece from scratch. It’s a reminder of that which we already know, an experience which can’t and shouldn’t be decorated with any extra imagery or descriptive language. 

The recipe card is a map of the place we’ve already been. A recording of the concert that we experienced. Reading a card with instructions can’t re-construct the experience of eating and enjoying life, but it can show our footprints in the sand.
