One of my in-laws once said that therapy isn&#8217;t akin to cleaning out your attic; rather, it&#8217;s like turning on a light. It always intrigued me, and I believe in proactive and preventative care, so I promised myself I&#8217;d try it if I could.

Over the last few months, I&#8217;ve walked away from each of my therapy sessions with a new insight. A new piece of info about how my brain works, about how I communicate. About how others in my life communicate, and how I can tune into this to be more harmonious with them.

And I&#8217;ve since revised the original simile. It&#8217;s a light in the attic, sure, but it is more like my brain is a maze. There are fears, worries, bullies from the past around ever corner. There is also joy, hope, and every warm hug I&#8217;ve ever received.

Therapy is like me walking blindfolded along the inside walls of this maze and my therapist is letting me know there&#8217;s a wall coming up. She&#8217;s letting me know how to feel the sidewalls for vines and how to sense potholes.

She&#8217;s teaching me how to navigate, something that no one else, not even a close friend can do.

“Talk to someone” is a common way of telling someone to find a therapist, to imply they have yet to understand the structure and texture of their own walls.

It&#8217;s not as easy as talking. If it were, therapy could be a coffee date with a friend. Which helps me make decisions and feel grounded, but it doesn&#8217;t give me a navigation tool for the maze.

That navigation tool, by the way, isn&#8217;t a map. I can&#8217;t see what&#8217;s coming. It&#8217;s more like a training on the textures of my mind. By knowing how the walls feel, and knowing what that means, I can find my way just a bit easier.
