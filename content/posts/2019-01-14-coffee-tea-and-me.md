Some days, I&#8217;m coffee.

I wake up with purpose. My bed is made. I&#8217;m at the kitchen table reading the paper an hour before work. The kids have dressed themselves.

I enter the conference call with confidence. I speak my name as a trochee, emphasis on the first syllable. I&#8217;m not asking, I&#8217;m telling.

I bust through the to do list like I&#8217;m cranking a lever. By noon I&#8217;ve finished my most important tasks. I&#8217;ve set goals for the rest of the week.

I love like it&#8217;s the last day on earth. I grip my kid like I&#8217;m holding a bat at home plate.

I pour through grinds ferociously. I&#8217;m satisfied and, like I expected, I fit right into the shape of the cup. I might die tomorrow, or I might live for a hundred years.

But some days, I&#8217;m tea.

I get out of bed as if I&#8217;m immortal. Every day has little relative importance, but worth living nonetheless.

I make my day up on the spot. I write new songs and throw away old ones. I play solitaire, or Jenga. I walk in the park for an hour, maybe two.

I work on the initial stages of the project. I figure there&#8217;s always tomorrow. And if not, then there&#8217;s always later today.

I sing like a warm hug, I take in the smell of your shirt, the just-done laundry. I let you lie on my chest, fall asleep there even. You sigh at the lights like they&#8217;re the most beautiful thing you&#8217;ve ever seen.

I seep through the molecules in the air and my thoughts start to expand. I don&#8217;t fit in the cup, the cup is just a construct. I am bigger than the bag, I am stronger than the cloves.

But today? Today I am soda. Today my mind keeps igniting with bursts of motion.

And then my thoughts glide invisibly into the air, slowly, carefully, one bubble at a time.
