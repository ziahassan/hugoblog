here is definetely a first time for everything. Usually when it's a possible snowday I get really hopeful that they will cancel school. But I just don't feel that way about tommorow. I want school so I can get my exam done and then go out to brunch with my girlfriend. That'd be a great day.

Today I recieved my last math quiz in high school EVER. I was so excited about that. My grades are looking like this for the end of the quarter.

Stat &#8211; B  
English &#8211; B/C?  
TV &#8211; A  
Theory &#8211; B  
Creative Writing &#8211; A  
Internship &#8211; A  
Psych &#8211; B

It's lookin great. Ya know it is WAY too late. I need sleep. No entry for tonight.
