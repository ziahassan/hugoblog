The Choose Your Own Adventure series isn&#8217;t as popular these days as it was when I was a kid. 

The library used to be flooded with these books. You could make choices about the plot and read the book non-linearly to have an adventure. The stories were captivating too. 

As a teacher, I made sure that these books had a place in my classroom. Though I advertised them as “ video games in the form of books,” these books taught a secondary and profound lesson. 

_Choices matter._

Each door we choose to open, each person we choose to speak with, each step, each breath&#8230; the sum of all of it is an adventure that we get to craft ourselves. Our story is unique and beautiful simply because of the autonomy we have in life. 

And while you can&#8217;t ever forget a storyline, it&#8217;s possible to begin again at any time.
