For five minutes a day, over the last few months, I&#8217;ve spent time doing nothing.

That is, I sit on a cushion or chair, without my phone, staring straight ahead at the wall.

Thoughts come and go and I observe them like the weather. Or at least, I try to &#8211; and if I get swept away, I forgive myself and try again.

It&#8217;s been a wonderful experience, not because it&#8217;s been calming or new age, but it&#8217;s enabled me to allow pain, happiness, and other emotions come to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. 

Since meditation is a silent and personal activity, it always made me curious that people want to do it in groups. Monks at temples, buddhist practitioners, yoga classes&#8230; all include some form of group meditation. But a group can&#8217;t meditate, can they? What&#8217;s the benefit?

I discovered my answer to this while using the amazing meditation timer app InsightTimer. 

But first, let&#8217;s talk about breathing. Pema Chodron describes the act of breathing like this: when we inhale, we pull in everyone&#8217;s pain. When we breathe out, we send good vibes out to the rest of the universe. This can be a very healing experience in a room of people meditating silently.

InsightTimer rings a bell at the start and end of a meditation session. And then, it does something powerful: it shows you all the other people that were meditating with you. You just see their first name and profile pic, nothing fancy. But in doing so, I suddenly realized that all of the 400-600 people that meditate with me across the world every day (and many more not on the app) are _all_ experiencing the same struggle that I am &#8211; to remain grounded in the present moment.

So while meditation _is_ a solitary activity, doing it in a group reminds us that we&#8217;re all experiencing an internal struggle that is invisible from the outside.
