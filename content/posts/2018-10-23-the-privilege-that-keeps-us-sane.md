Sanity is fleeting these days. I feel it. You probably feel it too.

Most of this discomfort seems to do with a certain balance between certainty and uncertainty. On one hand, predictability and routine make us feel safe and comfortable. Maybe it&#8217;s the 30-something in me, but IÂ _love_ waking up and feeling like I can predict what will happen in my day.

In fact, one of the first things I learned when I became a teacher is how much kids love routine. Truth is, people love routine&#8230; it just needs to be explicitly stated that kids love routine because it&#8217;s up to adults to set that routine. Adult routines are fairly self-working given our societal structure. Mealtimes are set, recreational time is set (after COB), work time is set (9-5), and weekends are our wildcards.

But all of this would be very boring without uncertainty. Crazy news stories, personal anecdotes that are extraordinary, illness, death, tragedy&#8230; all become the blips, waves, and tsunamis in the otherwise boring day-to-day.

So we stay sane, surfing between the certain and the uncertain. Too much certainty and we&#8217;re doomed to boredom. Too much uncertainty and we&#8217;re constantly in a tailspin, fending for our lives.

This balance, of course, is a privilege. There are families and individuals who don&#8217;t have a predictable day-to-day. And the stress associated with that kind of life is what proves to me how much humans need it, and how life can be so unfair and inequitable.
