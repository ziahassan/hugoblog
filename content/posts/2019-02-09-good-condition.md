What do you think of when I say the word nourishment?

Food, perhaps. Particularly food that is healthy, contains vitamins, etc.

But maybe it&#8217;s deeper than that. The dictionary says:

<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.ziahassan.com/daily/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_2929.jpg?resize=1125%2C444&#038;ssl=1" class="wp-image-664 size-full" width="1125" height="444" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.ziahassan.com/daily/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_2929.jpg?w=1125 1125w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ziahassan.com/daily/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_2929.jpg?resize=300%2C118 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ziahassan.com/daily/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_2929.jpg?resize=768%2C303 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.ziahassan.com/daily/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img_2929.jpg?resize=1024%2C404 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> 

So it&#8217;s not just a reference to food, but can also include &#8220;other substances.&#8221;

And it&#8217;s not that the substances we use are the _cause_ of our good growth, health, and condition, it&#8217;s that they contribute to the environment that exists around us, and those variables make it easier to grow and be in good condition.

A gardener doesn&#8217;t take responsibility for the growth of plants; they take responsibility for creating necessary conditions for growth to take place.

Nourishment is how you set the table.
