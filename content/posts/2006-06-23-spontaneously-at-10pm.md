I've had to put together about 3 binders today.&nbsp; The rest of the day I've sat around listening to music and reading about synthesizers.&nbsp; I did find a cool website called longnow.org which has lectures about forward thinking.&nbsp; Stewart Brand created this orgnization who found it interesting that different people of different cultures envisioned the concept of "now" very differently.&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you asked someone what they were working on "now," would they refer to what they've been doing that hour?&nbsp; That morning?&nbsp; That year?&nbsp; The Long Now organization has decided to make "now" encompass the next 10,000 years.&nbsp; They've even made a clock that plays bells.&nbsp; They have all of their lectures on the site, and I was listening to the kick-off speech from Eno.&nbsp; He began by talking about his first ambient record (discreet music, which I still haven't heard), and then went onto the other ambient ones and explained why they relate to time and "now." &nbsp;

Last night, Mariam and Billy came over to watch Prison Break.&nbsp; I love re-watching that show unfold.&nbsp; PJ called and said he was home, so him and Andy joined later.&nbsp; I should've napped but I spent the entire afternoon playing with my new gear.&nbsp; Made a quick demo of 2 birds, just to see how it sounded when I was fully listening, and also did a verse and chorus of Bows and Arrows in Garage Band.&nbsp; That one actually came out sounding nice.

Then I saw an amazing video of an Indian guy who created a synth out of&nbsp; a really cool usb device with a bunch of colored balls.&nbsp; He throws the balls around and where they hit the wall is where they change velocity and shape.&nbsp; I want to learn to make music with forces that I can't control, like throwing a ball: it lands in a different place everytime, you did the initial work, and physics took care of the rest.&nbsp; Drawing on a higher power.

After Prison Break, we went to Andy's to watch the storm.&nbsp; Big streaks of lightning, so big that they lit up the entire sky.&nbsp; We couldn't do the lightning-thunder calculation because there was too much lightning, we couldn't figure out what corresponded to what.&nbsp; We sat on his deck, sheilded by the short ceiling, smoking fruit, and watching the lightning.&nbsp; I'm glad PJ picked last night to be home.

Idea:&nbsp; Compose a series of short stories, that will eventually become songs.&nbsp; Then, write a series of songs that will eventually become short stories.&nbsp; We'll call this skill development.

Andy caught me off guard the other night with the question: What is it about music that you feel emotionally connected to?&nbsp; I gave him the answer that I've always believed, that music is a higher being. &nbsp; He went to ask me if that meant that music was a better form of communication than words.&nbsp; Too much one-dimensional thinking, and too much black-or-white.&nbsp; (From Contact) I'll never be able to articulate it, but every inch of me knows that it exists.&nbsp; People don't use the idea of God as a communication tool, they draw energy, love, whatever from that higher being which is available to them all the time, day or night. &nbsp;

Last night, Andy said that to him, lightning is proof that there is a God.&nbsp; To me, it's all spread over different channels.&nbsp; Lightning, music, particles.&nbsp; Wherever it appears that is relative to you.

Plans for tonight:&nbsp; Go to the library and pay for my overdue library books, check out new ones that I inevitably won't read.&nbsp; But it's nice to know that they're there.&nbsp; I'll see if I can find anything on Dark Matter.&nbsp; Sleep, maybe try recording.&nbsp; Head over to Scott's to work out arrangements and sing a little.&nbsp; Hopefully he's written a song.&nbsp;

Tommorow is the weekend.&nbsp; This has been a long week.&nbsp;
