At a workshop once, the participants were asked to write out their values, the things that were important to them in life. Among the responses, people said their family, friends, art, and their passions were among the most valued things their life.

Then they were asked to write what they do with most of their days. Among these responses were “email, scrolling social media, having meetings…” etc. 

How close do your values match what you do every single day? Perhaps you feel it’s out of your control. But this exercise of comparing your values to your daily activities can help empower you. It can inform you. It can help you understand that you have more control than you think.
