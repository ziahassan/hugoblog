We humans have an interesting way of deciding what’s real and what’s not real. We give things meaning.

When they make synthetic diamonds in a lab, who’s to say they aren’t “real?” Sure, they aren’t real in the context of our definition of diamonds. But they are as real as anything else in this world. 

We decide meaning, based on context, and in doing so, we decide what is real.
