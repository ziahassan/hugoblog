So luckily, Bryan didn&apos;t start the permanent schedule till Tuesday. But my week looks like this:  
Monday, I wake up at 5:30 am for a two hour shift. Class at 11:20, Lab at 12:45-3:25. Practice at 10-12.

Tuesday, I wake up at 8:15 for three classes, done by 12:35 and then I can do whatever the fuck I want. Tuesday will be my awesome day.

Wednesday, I wake up at 5:30 again for a 2 hour shift. Class at 12:45-3:25. Not too shabby, gives me about 4 hours of sleep if I want it. Practice at 10-12.

Thursday, I wake up at 7:30 for a 2 hour shift. Class at 11:20. Another shift at 1:30-5:30. Thursday will be my painful day.

Friday, I wake up at 8:15 for my three classes in a row till 12:35. But then I&apos;m done. It&apos;s funny, I never thought the days where I had 8:30&apos;s and three classes in a row would be my awesome days that I am probably gonna be looking forward too.

The last few semesters I&apos;ve been able to wake up lateish, like around 10 most days, some later. This semester, all my shit happens in the morning. I&apos;m basically going the Chris Barrick route. Let&apos;s see how it turns out.
