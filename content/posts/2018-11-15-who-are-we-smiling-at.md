When someone takes a photo of us, we are asked to smile. But at whom?

It&#8217;s not the person taking the picture, so it must be the camera. 

The camera, the thing that sees our perfect moments, the ones that show us living our lives in an enviable way. 

Does the camera know that we are lying? Or is it stupid and oblivious to all the pain the lies behind a simple selfie?
