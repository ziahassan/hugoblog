Escalators: stand to the right, walk to the left. 

Until someone forgets this unspoken and unposted rule, and stands jutting out a little bit into the left side of the moving stairs. 

It&#8217;s impolite, it breaks the norm&#8230; but then, the escalator is short, and the ride is only a few more seconds. Saying something to the esca-lefter would be assertive, but would save me about two extra seconds, at this point. 

And so by the time I work up the nerve to even confront the esca-lefter, we are up the escalator, and all of my frustrations are no longer relevant. 

I forget about the whole thing. This happens multiple times a day in different situations, each with their own minor inconveniences.

This is what they mean when they say not to sweat the small stuff.
