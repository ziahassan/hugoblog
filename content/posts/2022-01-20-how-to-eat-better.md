The secret to eating better was lost on me for years.

I tried diet plans, reducing calories, time-restricted eating, the works.

What eventually worked for me was learning to cook intuitively. 

I started to understand what went into making meals: some kind of protein, a starchy carb or vegetable, and perhaps some kind of fat. This is just the formula that I prefer, but could vary depending on who you are.

I learned how to use marinades and spices to make my meals taste more delicious. And, as as result, I now eat better.

All meals are composed of whole, unprocessed foods, and unlike in years past, I _actually enjoy eating these foods._

The key to eating better is learning how to make food you love.
