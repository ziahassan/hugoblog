This is the longest I’ve ever left the blog without posting. For the past year or so, I’ve posted every day… and there’s been almost a week between this post and my last.

I was sick, like _very_ sick, with one of those 24-hour stomach bugs.

What I realized during the thick of it was that the problems I was currently thinking about _before _ I got sick were now relatively meaningless. I had a deadline for my job to meet, I was out of town for a wedding and navigating new faces (which for an introvert is fun but exhausting). All of that mattered very little when I found myself unable to move from my bed to go anywhere.

And when I finally lost my fever and came back to normal, which took a few days, there was no greater feeling in the world. Many of us, including me, really take health and our range of choices for granted.
