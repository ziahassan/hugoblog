When I was a kid, I wanted to be a pop star. I was thrilled by the idea of writing songs and performing on stages. 

So, to satisfy myself, I began performing on stages, playing my own songs at the age of 7. At family gatherings, I&#8217;d dance like Michael Jackson. In high school, I&#8217;d play my songs at parties and I&#8217;d think super carefully about my set list and banter. I&#8217;d perform magic for anyone who would watch. I still do these things. 

I wasn&#8217;t really _good_. But to me, it didn&#8217;t get any better than this. To be able to create something interesting on the spot, live, in front of people&#8230; was exhilarating. 

It all changed after college. I got self conscious. I was afraid of releasing things. I realized that everyone else thought magic was for geeks. 

I could learn a lot from my younger self, as much as I shit on him. Because the secret was that back then I wasn&#8217;t _trying_ to be something, I wasn&#8217;t even doing the “fake it till you make it” thing. 

No, I was just completely delusional. Which I&#8217;m starting to believe is what it takes to be a true artist.
