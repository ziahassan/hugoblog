Strangely enough I'm in a bad mood. Mainly because I'm tired right now. Partly because I just finished watching some depressing TV drama called Miracles. It's become an obsession, I watch it every time there is a new episode.

I don't think I ever got around to writing about closing night. But I didn't cry. A few people did, and it's understandable, but it's taking a while for things to hit me that way nowadays.

Ugh. Can't write while I'm in a bad mood.
