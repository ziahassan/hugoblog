Well to explain my subject we saw Blood Brothers tonight at Northwest (broadway bound put it on) and 3 of my good friends were leads&#8230; and I was extremely impressed with all of them. Jesus, my boy Blaemire, I really hadn't seen him on stage for a while. Since west side actually, I'm pretty sure. And good lord, I was proud to say I knew him&#8230; and amy, jesus christ, and of course danny. They put on a great show. If your reading this on saturday morning, go the show tonight at northwest high school for 8 bucks at 8 o clock. WOW.

Crunch week is coming to an end. Just review day and then exams. Ya know what's pretty fuckin annoying? Alright, check this. I take an exam. I know half of the answers, I get a 50. Someone else doesn't know anything, 0 percent. They're both the same letter. I think it should be spread out better. But then again everything can't be my way can it.

Ms. Mattey should realize that I am so dedicated. I came into that class not taking it seriously at all. I mean, computer apps. Bullshit, eh? Anyway, first quarter I still pulled off an A. Second quarter I have a B&#8230; and I've worked so much harder this quarter. I have to get an A on the exam otherwise I'm so screwed. Man there are a lotta things I gotta do. It's gonna snow tommorow and I have a recording session with Danica. Hopefully we won't get snowed in.

I need somethin to eat. I'm thinkin about gettin some pasta. That involves too much moving though ðŸ™‚

Man I love snow. We're probably gonna get nothing though. I'm staying up now, simply cuz I love staying up late at night and listening to music. And I have to say David Garza is an excellent latenight companion. I need to find out the name of this song.

"sold is a four letter. and don't forget to say baby baby baby baby&#8230; sold is a 4 letter scam. dj's won't play your jam unless ya say baby baby baby&#8230;."

I can't tell if the words are "soul" or "sold." But anyway this guy is fuckin awesome.

Yes, I still hate my life. Tonight made me feel a ton better about things. But I know it's just gonna continue.

I believe PJ said it best when he said "why are some girls soooo fucking hot?" honestly&#8230; I don't wanna get too American beauty on you, but there really is just so much beauty in the world. Most of it lies in women. I dunno what it is about em. They're just so soft, so gentle. To me, girls are like practicing zen. Complete peace of mind in something that is so simple that you don't know why didn't get it in the first place. I dunno what to do. I think about girls being beautiful too much. Like, it's always on my mind.

Whatever happened to the days when sweetness got you girls? "he's ugly but he's so sweet." I guess that don't work anymore. Either that or I've stopped being sweet. Or it's stopped being 7th grade. Either one. I'm incredibly tired now, and jon is trying to get DMB tickets for us both. Server is being screwy with him but that is imaginable, since dave tickets just went on sale for the club members.

Nick came over today and we traded CDs. Nick is great. So is music. Nick is like my musical guru. Him and utkarsh that is. They are my jesus christ's of music. Thanks for opening my head and making the path from the door to the bed a little more broad. Pickin up the dirty underwear or something.

I really wanna learn everything there is to know about each genre of music. Ya know, just the basics. And then as far in as I need to go. I feel that this will make me a better producer. Does that mean I have to like every single genre of music? Well I pretty much already do. Some country is a little unbearable though. Some is great though. Like jessica andrews. She rocks.

Well it's time to post this shit and go to bed.

Let's paint the town red like kerry ðŸ™‚
