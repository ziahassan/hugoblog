&#8230; to see what he could see. 

The bear went over the mountain, but not for food, or money, or fame, or glory. 

The bear went over the mountain due to his overwhelming curiosity. 

To see what he could see, from a new vantage point. 

The bear went over the mountain, the bear went over the mountain&#8230; itâ€™s simple, really. 

To see what he could see, that&#8217;s all. No expectations, no promises, no guarantees, no filters, and no judgment.
