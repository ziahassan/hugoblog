A blog post that really influenced my thinking was Derek Sivers post titled [“Hell Yeah.”][1] In the post, Derek advises his readers to say no to anything that they don’t want to say “hell yes” to. And knowing that this isn’t always possible, at least it can be a default framework with which to make decisions.

As a consultant, my instinct is to say yes to everything that seems like it could eventually be important. It stresses me out and slows me down, though. Eventually, all of those yesses create quite a few messes. 

I think it’s important to monitor the inputs in our lives. I’m blessed to have so many things to say yes to, and also a constantly evolving idea of what offers are important and which ones can wait for someone else.
