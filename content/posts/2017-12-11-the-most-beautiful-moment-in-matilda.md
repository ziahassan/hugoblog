It’s at the very start of the book. Matilda discovers her local library, and starts to read everything on the shelves. She finishes all the kids books, and then moves on to the adult books.

At some point, the librarian informs her that public libraries allow one to take books home.

Her reaction: could _I_ do it?

This, after books were basically banned from her household. This, after she had to find refuge from her terrible parents at a local library. This. Portable literacy. Like when I got a walkman after years of being chained to a plugged in record player (I spun _Bad_ and _True Blue_ if you must know).

Roald Dahl doesn’t describe Matilda’s face during this scene. But if he did, I imagine it would qualify for the most awesome visual in the book.
