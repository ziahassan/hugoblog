When I noticed that my carâ€™s dashboard calendar was off I tried to adjust it. It was off by a year in the past. When I tried to adjust it, I found it only went up to 2018 &#8211; pressing the forward button one more time set me back to 1999. The manufacturer had not considered a world in which this car would still be in use after 2018. 

To be stuck in the past is a serious situation. I&#8217;d feel the same way if the car was stuck on a future date too. If you&#8217;re living in the past, it&#8217;s hard to enjoy the fullness of the present moment. Impossible, even. 

There are millions of people who are so scared of the future that they willingly _choose_ to live in the past. I&#8217;ve experienced this. Call it depression, call it anxiety, call time resistance. 

Driving around in this broken system, maybe I&#8217;ll start to forget what year it really is. Maybe I&#8217;ll show up for parties that have already happened. Maybe I&#8217;ll forget recent events and be stuck in 2018. 

It&#8217;s a dangerous place to be, the past. The future is no better. But both are static. Like a diving board above a raging sea, and no urgency to jump. You can stare at the violent waters as long as you want. 

The present moment though gives us a thrilling chance to surf.
