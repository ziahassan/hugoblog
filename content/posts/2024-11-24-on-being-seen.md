Some things happen quickly; other things sneak up on you.

I was chatting with a friend recently who used to feel like they were the least valued person in their workplace.

They felt inexperienced, a sense of imposter syndrome, you name it.

This was just a few years ago.

But recently, they turned around and looked in the mirror.

In just a few years, they transitioned from a rookie to training new staff and earning their bossâ€™s deep trust.

It's amazing: we hope so deeply to be seen, not realizing that there's a background process going on. 

And that's what being seen is: a process. 

And it's a cumulative one. It starts with the smallest of actions, the smallest of noticings, the smallest of accomplishments.

Accomplishing something small, knowing it may not work but doing it anyway... these are all skills of the modern worker.

Do it long enough, and you will be seen.

But you can't hide. 

You have to come out of the shadows, scream your mission statement into the world, and then get after it with as much tenacity as all the people who came before you.
