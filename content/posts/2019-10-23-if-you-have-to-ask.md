Scrolling through my Twitter feed, I ran across a tweet that ended with “PLEASE MAKE THIS GO VIRAL.”

Whoever this person is, they don’t really understand how viruses work. If content goes viral, it happens nearly automatically, which means there was no need for the request in the first place. 

How many artists and entrepreneurs could save time if they just stopped asking for people to share things, and instead made things that people want to share?

People don’t make things go viral; viral ideas are engineered to spread. Whether intentional or not.
