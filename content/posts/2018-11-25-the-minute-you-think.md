The minute you think that you know about something, you discover you&#8217;re a novice.

The minute you think you’re too old, you’re crying for your mom.

The minute you think you’ve missed the bus, there’s one coming around the corner.

The minute you think that the moment has passed, another one has taken its place (and another one has already taken the second one’s place).

The minute you think that it’s going be to _this way_, another path illuminates, taking you _that_ way.

The minute you think, think again.
