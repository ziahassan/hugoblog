&#8220;You&#8217;re beautifully flawed,&#8221; someone once said to me.

But is there any type of flaw that isn&#8217;t beautiful? Is there such thing as an ugly flaw?

I suppose what people mean when they say &#8220;beautifully flawed&#8221; is that they find my more challenging qualities endearing. They&#8217;re trying to communicate, in a compassionate way, that they accept me for who I am. 

But they do this because they know me, because we are friends. They&#8217;ve seen me at my worst, and they still went on loving me anyway. But when a politician or movie producer has some obvious flaws in their character, they aren&#8217;t beautiful anymore &#8211; they&#8217;re repulsive and horrible. 

Assuming no one is perfect (or everyone is perfect), we&#8217;ll all have qualities that others will either see as horrible, no good flaws, or beautiful flaws. 

In other words, _we_ are the ones who assign values to other people&#8217;s flaws. We are the ones who say whether someone else&#8217;s flaws are beautiful or repulsive. In other words, we reserve judgment.

What to do then, as a human with flaws being judged by others? Perhaps the best course of action is to not assign value to our own flaws. Let&#8217;s let other people do it for us, for that is their task and has nothing to do with us, and let&#8217;s keep on living and moving forward with whatever it is we&#8217;ve got.
