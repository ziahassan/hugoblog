We can use a stimulus to activate dopamine. We can take a chemical to activate more brain chemicals.

It’s like our brain is just sitting there, _begging_ to be stimulated. The things with which we stimulate it vary from person to person. 

A sunset, moonlight, an incredible film, a moving song… non-chemicals that induce chemical reactions, or chemicals that induce chemical reactions. It doesn’t matter.

In all cases, we’re setting off fireworks with each and every move, and we’re watching them dissipate, staying ready for more.
