So I&apos;m at work, and there&apos;s a pizza man who is deaf and dumb, he communicates through paper. Here&apos;s my convo with him:

D: What&apos;s wrong?  
Z: No one is picking up!  
D: Can you phone room 531 or 529 to tell room 530 that is pizza is here?  
Z: I think she hung up on me. I&apos;m not sure what to do.  
D: &#8230;some rooms have parties with beers.

And then he leaves.
