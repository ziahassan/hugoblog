I could spend all the time spent trying to entertain you  
I'm the Peter Pan of your early years&#8230;

I could make you a portrait  
and call it personal  
I could make it multi colored  
and paint it white  
and be original

and I could write all the songs that are floating around in my head  
but your hard of hearing when it comes to this

so I'm gonna have to wait  
while you do figure 8's  
and make scratch marks in my chest  
while you comment on all the rest

and I can hold my breath  
for longer than you think  
give me something to float on  
before I start to sink

and I could paint you beautiful murals  
and put em round your bed  
and you'd fall asleep staring at the ceiling

I could wave my hands in front of your face  
but you'd walk on by  
you'd walk on by  
walk on by&#8230;
