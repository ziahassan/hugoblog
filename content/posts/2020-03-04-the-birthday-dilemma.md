Do I leap out of bed and dig in to my day? Or do I do what my body clearly wants to do and sleep in?

Do I spend the day checking email and Facebook or do I do something more productive? My intuition says this is a day for celebration, the act of marking one’s pleasure by doing an enjoyable activity. And enjoyable to me means I take control, instead of algorithms. 

And tomorrow, when it’s the day after my birthday, do I return to normal or remember what I’ve learned? Do I keep this attitude of day-seizing, and if so, how long does it last?

Can I live inside the birthday mentality indefinitely?
