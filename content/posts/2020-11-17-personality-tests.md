Whether it’s Meyers-Briggs or simple astrology (I’m a pisces), people love personality tests. Sure, it’s possible that if you believe in them hard enough, _any_ result, even a random one, would make a person say “yeah, that’s me.&#8221;

Although some personality tests may have merit, most of what they do is organize our messy mask of a persona into a simple narrative. 

What a gift.
