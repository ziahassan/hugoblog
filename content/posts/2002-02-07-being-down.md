Being down sucks dick. I heard myself in the recordings of the winter concert as well as hit parade. I wanted to throw up. At the time of both of those shows, I thought I did an ok job. Especially with the winter concert, I thought I performed really well. And I'm listenin to this recording wanting to vomit. I hate it, I can't stand it. Nothing is going right for me. Now whenever I recieve a compliment I'm gonna think it's a flat out lie. No matter what. People will say things all the time, it's never fucking true. But if they said what they really thought they woudln't be being polite. And fuck! I don't blame them. Who the fuck wants to be blunt about things, and tell you that you suck? No one wants that, no wants to be told that or tell that. So your only left with one option &#8211; LIE. and LIE WELL.

My head goes back and forth between wanting to give up creating music and then keeping at it. My songs, quite frankly, are disgusting and my voice is even worse. If you think I'm fishing for compliments here, close your fucking browser and shove your head back up your ass. In fact, if you dont' like the fact that I'm freaking out in my journal here, close your fucking browser. You don't have to read this.

I'm almost wondering why I'm not making this a private post. Maybe it's becuase I really don't give a shit anymore. I've fucking had it with everyone's problems with me. " I whine too much, I'm luckier than I know, I'm good at what I do, I'm attractive&#8230; etc" It's all fucking bullshit. These are things people say becuase they feel that they need to be a good friend and make you feel better. And well, quite ironically, they are doing the right fucking thing.

I wish there was someone who could understand me, cuz I reallly understand me, and I wish someone else would. And I hope it's a girl for once. I really really hope it's a girl. I know it doesn't help much that I'm freaking out here. And it's probably becuase of chem to be completely honest. Probably becuase of this damn internship thing that I'm worrying about. Like, if it works out, will I have a car? If I don't have a car, do I have to be obligated to have an internship? If I say that I'm not sure if I have a car, will that affect my chances of getting the internship? All these fucking questions that I am too afraid to ask anyone. Why? Cuz I'm afraid of a bad answer.

Nick Blaemire comes over tommorow. Tommorow is Friday. Two things I have to look forward to tommorow. And possibly grant's package will arrive and I'll have some new music to listen to over the weekend.

Goddamn. I gotta see my counselor tommorow, I really hope she's available to answer my fucking questions. And I reallly hope this whole internship thing works out. Really really really.

I'm mad at myself for being pissed off, but I can't help it. Bad grades, beautiful girls everywhere that don't know I exist, and a shitty future, and not even the talent to make gold out of shit that I've been handed. I used to think I used to have it. I don't think I used to have it anymore. It was all just one big fucking joke. I really don't care anymore. They've made life so fucking hard to get through. All numbers, everything is numbers. My GPA, my SAT scores, all in fucking numbers. They've really made me care so much about it, when I don't even know if I really need to. And I wanna do what I wanna do. THAT IS THE BOTTOM LINE. I really just want to be a people's person. I want to work in a studio. I want to make money though.

My mom's sorta siding with me. My dad's sorta not.

I love T.S. Elliot poems. We're reading them in english and goddamn, amazing stuff. I think I'll even end this entry with an awesome quote from him.

"In the room where women come and go, and talk about michelangelo."

just a lie i've got to rise above&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;
