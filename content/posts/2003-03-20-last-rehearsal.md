My last rehearsal on the Wootton stage today. Didn't feel any different from other rehearsals. I'm gonna feel it later I'm sure. Well tommorow's the night&#8230; apache and freshman game&#8230; and opening night. It really crept up&#8230; especially since I came into rehearsals a month into the picture. It will be SO incredibly nice to not have rehearsal after school anymore. To think, my sister and I are actually going to come home tommorow! Haha!

Well here's the bottom line : our show is ready. Even though we missed like 5 rehearsals we are so caught up and so ready to get this shit on. Brodsky even said our show looked amazing. Really good. He complemented me! Said that I had passion. That was cool of him, it made me feel good.

I can tell this show's gonna be mad crazy cool. Goin out with a bang.

Sister and mom shouting now. Eyes closing. Sleepy time.
