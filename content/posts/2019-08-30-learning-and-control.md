In Star Wars, Yoda teaches Luke to control his power. Harry Potter is also trainer by his mentors. The ninja turtles turn to their sensei Splinter when they are out of control, and he grounds them with his calm and poised nature. 

Teaching and training is always like this. There&#8217;s no way to transmit knowledge as far as I know. The best we can do is assume our learners already have everything they need as beginners: curiosity, passion, and perseverance. 

The work, then, is all about self-control. When we learn how to control ourselves, our passions become assets.
