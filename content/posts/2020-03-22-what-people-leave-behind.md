Most of the stuff that the previous owners of our house kept here has been moved out, with some tiny exceptions. You can see in some rooms the little bumps that the spackle left behind. 

There are also stickers that presumably never came off. There are a couple of kid-looking stickers still on the window and one on the stove. I’m guessing they were difficult to remove. 

But it makes me curious: why were these stickers used in the first place? Were there children who just got bored and stuck them on things in the house? Was it a bonding activity? Did it come from a family who lived here even before them, and they wondered the same thing?

The things that people leave behind may have tremendous sentimental value. Or not. Or somewhere in the middle. We’ll never know.
