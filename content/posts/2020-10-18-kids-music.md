Having a child makes it easy to get sucked into all the kid music. Baby shark, Sesame Street, kids bop. 

Some of this stuff is fine to listen to, some of it is not. And remember, you have to listen to these songs on _repeat._ 

Bu there is no reason for kids music. It doesn’t serve a purpose other than perhaps lyrically, where it might teach an important lesson or be relatable. 

But the music? The notes? The same as adult music. Right now Dezi’s into a song that has lyrics about cocaine in a coffee cup.
