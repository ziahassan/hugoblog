A fun game to play: go to a Target with a friend or sibling, or any shopping mall that sells perfume. Take turns smelling perfume scents and guessing what the scent is titled. Check to see how close you were.

The result is the realization that the names are relatively arbitrary. Candles scents are more in line with reality. 

A title gives a product a concrete identity. But it doesn’t change the underlying qualities of the product. However, it can change the perception of that product, which can affect the product’s usefulness, strangely.
