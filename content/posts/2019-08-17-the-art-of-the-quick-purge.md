As I was building my recording studio in my early 20’s, it felt like I bought a new microphone every day. Not just microphones in fact, but pre-amps, software, headphones, guitars, and other various tools that I could use to make music. I’d buy some stuff, figure out it wasn’t for me, and then sell it on eBay or another site.

People thought I was crazy. Of course, I rarely re-sold these items for more or equal to what I paid, so what was the point? Surely the difference between two high quality microphones wasn’t that big. Also, when would I stop this cycle and just be happy with what I have?

I pondered the same questions that my friends and family were asking me. But eventually, I found the right set of gear. I’m not sure if I just grew out of the habit of buying new stuff, or I had just finally found a set up that worked for me, but either way, I was set. I haven’t bought another piece of music gear (other than as a replacement for something that broke) in over a decade. 

This process of quick purging also led me to the right computer keyboard when I was on the search for a new mechanical keyboard to write my book. I went through 4 different keyboards to find the right one. And though I experienced a number of amazing keyboards, the one that I originally thought would have the least appeal is the one that I went with.

I’m a technologists so I place a lot of importance on the type of tools that I’m using. Better to lose money re-selling something that doesn’t work than to be stuck with with a less-than-sufficient tool just because you bought it.
