When we say we’re lost in thought, we mean that we started listening a little too closely to the narratives in our head. We started watching thoughts like a movie, getting invested in the plot, the characters, the fictional elements of the past and future events of our lives.

But _who_ gets lost, exactly?

It’s not _me_ who gets lost in thought. _Me _is still driving. _Me _is still on a conference call. _Me_ isn’t lost in anything. _Me_ is the one having thoughts to begin with, so _who _is getting lost exactly? This question is much more important than its answer.

When you get lost in thought, find yourself in _right now_.
