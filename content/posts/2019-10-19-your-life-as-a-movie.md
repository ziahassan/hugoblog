In some ways, we experience our lives a bit like we might experience a movie. Events happen, we react to them. We’re the audience _and_ the protagonist. 

But, unlike the audience and protagonist, we end up creating emotions from scratch. We decide our own triggers, habits, likes, and dislikes. We decide what deserves the audience’s attention. 

Most people go through life feeling like the actor and the audience only, without realizing they also produce and direct this show, with a script that is being revealed in pieces, like episodes of a show. No one knows who the writer is, only that they’re crazy and need to be locked up.
