It is easy to feel behind in your career.

Like everyone else is surpassing you.

Like all the dreams you had a few years ago are still unrealized, and that other people are filling in those gaps that you wanted to fill.

If you've ever had a huge dream, sat on it for a few years and got distracted with meaningless busy work, you know what I'm talking about. 

The key to overcoming this is realizing the power of incremental progress.

I got this idea from David Allen's amazing book Getting Things Done years ago: you can't really do a project. However, you can do the steps needed to finish a project.

Maybe I can't write my dissertation tomorrow, but can I read 5 pages on my research topic?

Maybe I can't immediately get a job as an instructional designer. But can I follow 5 people who do that job to learn what their lives are like, and what they're thinking about on a day to day basis?

Maybe I can't build a house by the end of the week. But can I lay the first brick?

Focus on the next step.

What's yours?
