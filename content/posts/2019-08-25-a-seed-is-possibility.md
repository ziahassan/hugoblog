Is there anything more glorious than a seed? A tiny, rounded, object that goes into the ground and produces an entire forest. Sometimes, I’ll eat sunflower seeds and I’ll forget, conveniently, that each one contains the _possibility_ of an entire sunflower.

I’ve never watched a flower grow in slow motion. But I imagine it’s a lot like watching a child grow. Children seem to bend space and time, growing slowly a little bit every day, but _transforming_ as quickly as possible.

It’s so overwhelming that it’s easy to want to distract ourselves from thinking about it. But then we miss everything. And the only antidote that works is celebrating the seed and its infinite possibilities.
