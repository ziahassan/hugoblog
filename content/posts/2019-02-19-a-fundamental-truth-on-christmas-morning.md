I learned a fundamental truth about myself around Christmas in 1996.

That was the year that I convinced my dad to let me get a PlayStation for Christmas. The video game console had been out for a while, so I was late to the party. But it was fine because the most up-to-date system I owned was a Super Nintendo, which was outdated.

It worked. He agreed. We went to the video game store the weekend before Christmas and he bought me the PlayStation, along with a couple of games.

When we came back home, I was excited to try the new console.

&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to wait until Christmas morning?&#8221; he asked me.

&#8220;No,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;Too excited. Plus I&#8217;ll be busy with my other presents.&#8221;

Dad got serious and a little worried.

&#8220;There aren&#8217;t other presents for you on Christmas morning,&#8221; he said, carefully. &#8220;The PlayStation is it. It&#8217;s the monetary equivalent of your usual set of gifts.&#8221;

It was true.

For years, my parents had gotten me ten or so random but inexpensive gifts. They&#8217;d be scattered around the tree in the morning, some labeled &#8220;from mom and dad&#8221; and some labeled &#8220;from Santa.&#8221;

Sometimes they fulfilled requests, but never anything nearly as expensive as a PlayStation.

I cried and cried. Christmas was my favorite holiday and there was an intense enjoy in ripping open my presents. My parents were good at balance; some gifts would be things I indicated wanting and some were gifts my parents rightfully assumed I would like but that I hadn&#8217;t considered myself. And really, aren&#8217;t those the greatest presents?

&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a choice,&#8221; my dad told me. &#8220;I can return the PlayStation and get you your regular gifts, or you can keep the PlayStation but that&#8217;s all you get.&#8221;

I thought about it hard that night. And the next day at school.

The thought of Christmas morning without ripping open gifts was sad, but also, I had done the impossible and convinced my dad to buy me a PlayStation.

I asked my friends what they would do. All of them said they&#8217;d take the PlayStation.

&#8220;Who cares about one Christmas morning traditions?&#8221; a friend of mine shouted. &#8220;It&#8217;s a _PlayStation!_&#8221;

A rational thought. But I wasn&#8217;t rational. I was romantic and sentimental.

I told my dad to return the PlayStation and that I wanted a normal Christmas.

Sure enough, on Christmas, the tree was filled with inexpensive but thoughtful gifts. Every time I opened a bigger one, I half expected to see a PlayStation. I fantasized that my dad was bluffing, that it was too annoying at this point to take back. That he&#8217;d cave and let me have my cake and eat it too.

He didn&#8217;t. And there was a part of my 11 year old heart that felt wistful.

But I learned something important that Christmas. Which is that I valued tradition and familiarity on one special day more than having a PlayStation all year long.

I learned that I am not rational.

I learned that irrationality is a function of sentimentality.

I learned that my happiness is not always congruent with other people&#8217;s happiness.

And I learned to be okay with that.
