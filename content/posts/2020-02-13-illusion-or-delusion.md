There&#8217;s an important distinction. We trick ourselves most of the time. Especially with anything that involves the memory of the past. And definitely for what we believe the future holds.

In some ways, time and space are illusions. We trust that they are what we think they are. Everyone has to believe in time for it to work properly.

But delusion happens when only a small group or individual puts faith in an illusion. It&#8217;s a judgment, relative to all of the other false beliefs we inherit.
