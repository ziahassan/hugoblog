God it's way too late to be up, yet I am.

Today was Monday, a snowday, and it was a pretty good day all in all. I woke up around 11 or so and had a bagel for breakfast. And jesus, I just realized I haven't gotten out of the house at all.

Then I took David's lyrics and worked the shit out of them. The guy's got such talent&#8230; I wanted to write some music to the lyrics that worked and made a tune that did the lyrics justice. So I worked from like&#8230; 2-7 on it. Took about 2 hours to get the tracks down and about another 3 to mix the whole thing. The hardest thing was placing the beat in it so that it worked. And getting rid of some lyrics that might've been important to him. Then I had to add another verse&#8230; truly a dual effort. So today's been quite productive, and I feel really good about the recording. He hears it tommorow&#8230; will get the verdict then.

I watched Joe Millionaire tonight. It's that show where they tell 20 girls they're going to compete to marry a millionaire (50 mill to be exact)&#8230; but it's all a big lie, he makes like 19,000 a year. The chick are SO dumb. But joe's cool, I dig him. Hopefully he won't pick an idiot. There's one think I really dug, but I forgot her name.

Didn't do any homework, but what was I expecting? Hoping for a 2 hr delay tommorow. It's supposed to be icy&#8230; let's hope and pray.
