It&#8217;s always a treat to get a behind-the-scenes look at a thing.

After all, this is the process that created some beloved piece of art. It&#8217;s a peak into what the creators had to go through. The trial, tribulation, pain, and pleasure in the act of creating something new and unique. We imagine that the behind-the-scenes is full of bustling artists, fast-talkers, and brilliant strokes of genius.

And then we discover that the process behind most of the art we love was&#8230; well, kind of boring and hopeless. That the mixes on Abbey Road once sounded like shit before the release. That cleaning them up required a ton of work, none of which was very creative, exciting, or fun. Just tedious.

And tedium is the name of the game when it comes to behind-the-scenes. 

As passive audience members, we can&#8217;t possibly imagine a world in which our favorite piece of art is a 9-5 job. It&#8217;s hard to believe that the producers of big TV shows were probably just stressed out most of the time. We romanticize the scenes that go on in the background of the art we consume, but the scenes are a lot like real life&#8230; boring and/or tedious.
