How many Advil do you take? I ask people this question whenever they ask for medicine at my house.

Most people say two, but the minimum effective dose, which is the minimum amount of the medicine needed to remove your pain, is only one pill. Thereâ€™s a chance that people are confusing Advil with Tylenol, which has an MED of 2, according to the bottle.

When it comes to drugs, chances are we over do it more often than not. How many YouTube videos before we heal ourselves from a shitty day? How many Doritos to quench our craving at a party? How many glasses of wine does a romantic evening make?

How many words in a blog post to illustrate a point?
