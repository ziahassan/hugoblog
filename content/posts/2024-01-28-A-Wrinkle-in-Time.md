From the moment my third grader (or was it fifth? I had the same teacher for both) read this book to me, my life completely changed.

I think it's the first 3 or so chapters, which set up the rest of the book so beautifully. 

The way in which stars are characterized, are personalized.

The way that the generic theme of love vs. evil is told through the lens of the expansive realms of time and space.

The way that, for a brief moment, everything seems to make sense, much like the math problems that Meg attempts to solve with her father.
