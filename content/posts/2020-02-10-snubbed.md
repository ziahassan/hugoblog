Who exactly gets “snubbed” when they aren’t given an award?

We’re focused on the award more than we are focused on the way that art moves us emotionally. Of course, it makes sense that we’d want the official group in charge to validate our emotional connection to art. And of course, it feels good to recognize the voices of those who are marginalized.

But is it necessary to elevate voices beyond the art that has already gotten them a nomination at the Oscars? If we are to put any stock into winning this ceremony, then surely a nomination is quite an accomplishment as well, and also recognition of exemplary work.

Does a win mean the movie or director was inherently better? And is ranking movies or any art a useful practice?
