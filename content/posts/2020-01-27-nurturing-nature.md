The age old debate rages on: are we like this because that’s how we were made, or are we like this because society has given us a superficial roadmap?

I’ve started to believe that it doesn’t matter much.

After all, for most of us, this sort of inquiry is mostly for fun, at least when we talk on a societal scale. What’s more pressing is those who are in front of us everyday: our kids, our spouses, our parents, our friends. And even if we figured out that our friend is angry all the time because he has some kind of gene that causes anger, and his mother had it and so on… it doesn’t matter.

Isn’t nurturing still a part of nature? And doesn’t nature have the ability to nurture us? The way a waterfall changes us, a natural being influencing another natural being. 

And isn’t nature still a part of nurturing? Isn’t society and all of its flaws and beauties simply a byproduct of the natural unfolding of the cosmos?
