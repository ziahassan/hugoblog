I write a lot, and I always have. I prefer word processing to handwriting usually, because I get annoyed at how much I scribble over things when I write. 

I don&#8217;t use an eraser, even if I&#8217;m using a pencil. What&#8217;s the point? An eraser is for school children turning their work in to a teacher. It makes the page cleaner but it gives the illusion of perfection. 

Look at any of my old notebooks or index cards and you&#8217;ll find more scribbles than words. I&#8217;m no longer annoyed by this; it&#8217;s part of the process. To not scribble would require producing perfect writing on the first try, and that would require fooling myself. 

The only reason you don&#8217;t see scribbles on this blog is because I typed it. But while I was typing it, I was deleting and moving more words than you can imagine. 

Scribbles represent the act of filtering, of the editing process. And that is a process that provides the most clarity and value, more than even the ideas being edited.
