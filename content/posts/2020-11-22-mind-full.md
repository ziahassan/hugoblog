The word “mindful&#8221; implies that we’re “full of mind.” 

But a better term might be “mindlessness” because we lose our minds when we meditate or slip into a similar state of awareness (a tea ceremony, perhaps). 

And when we say we’re being mindless, we mean that we are distracted. But “mindless” is a misomer; really it&#8217;s that our mind is full.
