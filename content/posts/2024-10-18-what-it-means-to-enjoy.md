It occurred to me recently that the word _enjoy_ kind of sounds like "in joy." 

And maybe that's what it is.

To really enjoy something, you must steep yourself in it. Let it permeate. Simmer. Cook. Bake. Choose your kitchen analogy.

The more time you spend "in joy," the more you get the benefits of enjoyment.
