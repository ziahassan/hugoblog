I&#8217;m somewhat of a list ninja. I can create specific lists for any corner of my life and I have systems in place to execute on those lists properly. I&#8217;m always learning, but I&#8217;ve also _been_ learning for over a decade. 

Someone on a subreddit asked about how to start with todo lists. It made me think back to my start with to do lists. Back in 2006, when I realized I just wasn&#8217;t organized enough naturally, I turned to the Getting Things Done book to try and get myself together. 

My first to do list was a piece of paper. I had about 8 tasks. This was before I knew about _capture_, or the art of noticing the opportunity for new tasks. It&#8217;s likely why I was so unproductive. I was conducting my life based on how I felt on the moment, not with any true intention. 

Once I got better at capturing tasks, the number of items I had to deal with suddenly ballooned. I gathered a bunch of multicolored index cards and a space pen that I lost and repurchased many times. I put a binder clip on the cards and put them in my pocket. There was a list for business ideas, songs, blog posts, and general todo items. 

My life at the time, though it didn&#8217;t seem like it, was pretty simple. I had coursework and a job, and eventually the task of getting a post college job. That was about it. 

When I got my real job I had so many todos that my index cards weren&#8217;t really holding up. I had more tasks than ever, more categories of tasks than ever, so the system scaled: I started putting stickies on the perimeter of my cubicle, like how a cook takes orders. 

And as life got more intense, so did my system. In 2014, I discovered OmniFocus which allowed me to do things like hide tasks until a certain date, or only show one step of a project at a time, so I wouldn&#8217;t get overwhelmed and could break complex projects down. I was a teacher at the time, and became super reliable using OmniFocus. I was using OmniFocus by creating lists of location based contexts: I had a list for morning tasks at school, which was reserved for more cognitively demanding stuff like lesson planning. The afternoon list had more physical labor, like copying. 

And then as I started to get into the phase of my life involving property and children, my tasks yet again ballooned, and so did my system. I started using the perspective feature in OmniFocus, slicing up my tasks multidimensionally, by project and by context. One filter or perspective I use shows me tasks related to any project that isn&#8217;t considered creative, and is due within 4 days and/or flagged as high priority. Another one shows me all creative ideas yet to be executed on. It&#8217;s another layer on top of context and project, a modular way of bringing up only tasks that can be executed on quickly and immediately. 

At this point, a decade in, I like to think that I could handle any project that was thrown at me. Running a marathon, writing a book, stating a business, whatever. I went from 8 tasks on paper to hundreds of tasks with distillers and filters. 

But it will occasionally require me to scale my system. Which means my systems must remain scalable. And it&#8217;s important to pick the right moment to scale. Too late and you&#8217;re drowning, too soon and your productivity vehicle is about as good as a boat in a bathtub.
