here's some stuff I found.  
On a Sear's hairdryer:  
Do not use while sleeping.  
darn, and that's the only time I have to work on my hair.

On a bag of Fritos:  
You could be a winner! No purchase necessary. Details in side.  
the shoplifter special?

On a bar of Dial soap:  
"Directions: Use like regular soap."  
and that would be how&#8230;.

On some Swanson frozen dinners:  
"Serving suggestion: Defrost."  
but, it's "just" a suggestion.

On Tesco's Tiramisu dessert (printed on bottom):  
"Do not turn upside down."  
well&#8230;duh, a bit late, huh!

On Marks & Spencer Bread Pudding:  
"Product will be hot after heating."  
&#8230;and you thought?&#8230;

On packaging for a Rowenta iron:  
"Do not iron clothes on body."  
but wouldn't this save me more time?

On Boot's Children Cough Medicine:  
"Do not drive a car or operate machinery after taking this medication."  
We could do a lot to reduce the rate of construction accidents if we could just  
get those 5-year-olds with head-colds off those forklifts.

On Nytol Sleep Aid:  
"Warning: May cause drowsiness."  
and&#8230;I'm taking this because&#8230;.

On most brands of Christmas lights:  
"For indoor or outdoor use only."  
as opposed to&#8230;what?

On a Japanese food processor:  
"Not to be used for the other use."  
now, somebody out there, help me on this. I'm a bit curious.

On Sainsbury's peanuts:  
"Warning: contains nuts."  
talk about a news flash

On an American Airlines packet of nuts:  
"Instructions: Open packet, eat nuts."  
Step 3: maybe, uh&#8230;fly Delta?

On a child's superman costume:  
"Wearing of this garment does not enable you to fly."  
I don't blame the company. I blame the parents for this one.

On a Swedish chainsaw:  
"Do not attempt to stop chain with your hands or genitals."  
Oh my God&#8230;was there a lot of this happening somewhere?
