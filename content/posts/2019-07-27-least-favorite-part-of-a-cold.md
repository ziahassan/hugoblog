There are many phases to a cold. For example:

  * the raw and sore throat that makes you want to turn off swallowing for a while
  * the faint cough that precedes the onslaught 
  * the drippy nose faucet that turns on and off
  * the blockage that seems to only occur in one nostril, that can be controlled with gravity or turning your head to the side in bed
  * the aches and the pains
  * the way it starts hurting to blow your nose because of how raw the skin inside is
  * the endless coughing fits that persist weeks after the actual virus goes away

Which is my least favorite? It&#8217;s hard to pick. But if I had to pick, it&#8217;d be the feeling that is inherent to the entire process, the feeling that this will never go away, that I&#8217;m destined to live with this cold for the rest of my life. It&#8217;s the feeling of regret, of looking back to when I was healthy just a few days ago, with a feeling of longing. 

The best part of course is returning to normal. But that&#8217;s obvious.
