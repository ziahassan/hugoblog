Every system in life requires balance; therefore every system requires a budget.

Diet requires a budget of energy. How much do you spend? How much do you save or consume? The answer to this equation is different for every person but important to consider. Those who don’t might end up trying to fix a mess later on.

Fitness is the same. Can I increase the amount of energy expended, and how should I then consume calories/energy to compensate?

The same goes for joy and fear. How much do you budget joy? How do you spend your mental energy on fear appropriately? How much do you overspend? 

Budgets make life worth living because they provide balance between work and recovery. When we talk about work life balance, or a balanced diet, or an effective workout program… we’re talking about balancing the budget.
