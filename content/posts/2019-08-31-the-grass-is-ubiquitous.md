They say the grass is greener on the other side of the fence. What they don’t talk about is what happens when you end up on the other side of the fence. Yes, it’s implied that eventually the grass seems greener on the side you left, but there’s something even more ponderous at play.

The grass that you migrated to is now ubiquitous: what was once interesting and colorful and attractive now blends into the background. Once the novelty is gone, all you’re left with is what you’ve always had: your flaws, your anxieties, your joys, and your fears.

Perhaps it’s better not to go where the grass is greener, but where it’s more sparse, where it covers less of the earth, where it reveals instead of conceals.
