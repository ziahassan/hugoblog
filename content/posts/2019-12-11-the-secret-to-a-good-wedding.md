Many of my friends have told me that my wedding was one of the most fun events they’ve been to. What was our secret, they ask?

The venue we picked was gorgeous, with incredible decorations and atmosphere. We had an indoor area for eating and dancing, and an outdoor area for the ceremony. The location was perfect: Minneapolis in June, on a picture perfect day. And the ceremony itself was unique, combining wedding traditions from both Jewish and Indian/Muslim cultures. All of these variables contributed to the overall success of the wedding. 

But the magic, the part that I believe took it to a new level, was the guest list. We had so many guests from both families. We got to watch them intermingle and get to know each other, like little facets of our own personalities intermingling when we first met. 

If you do it right, your wedding guests from different sides of the family will fall in love with each other the way you did with your fiancee. It’s not about the quantity of the guests, but the quality.
