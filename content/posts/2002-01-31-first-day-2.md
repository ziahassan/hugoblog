It feels like the first day of school again. Not cus of the new semester, but because of the smell. I can't describe it. It's very strange.

Today I get to find out who I have classes with and such for the new semester. This could either be a really good thing or a bad thing. Hopefully this semester will be more enjoyable than last semester, which was pretty painful at times.

I have to go to school now, but I'm proudly wearing my new hemp necklace in place of my silver chain.

Lo and Behold!
