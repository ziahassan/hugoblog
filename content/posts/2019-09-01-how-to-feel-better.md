This isn&#8217;t about mood, or even wellness. It&#8217;s about the skill of _feeling_. How do we improve how we go about feeling?

If we hold an object, our skin is exposed to it, and we feel it automatically. 

We can also hold memories, experiences, happenings, and ideas. We can feel them, touch their ridges, rub their rough surfaces. 

But feeling better happens when we put the thing down. After we feel it, we go back to _not_ feeling it. We can remember that we felt it without needing to recreate the experience mentally or physically. 

In the process of feeling and then not feeling, we learn to feel better.
