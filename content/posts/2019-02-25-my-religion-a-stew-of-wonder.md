My first experience with religion happened when I was a child. I was told, right out of the gate, that I was Muslim. I attended a jamaat with my parents each Friday night, and celebrated Eid. 

My family also celebrated Christmas. It was probably because they wanted to make sure my sister and I didn&#8217;t miss out on any American fun as children. 

So here I was: an American Muslim kid with immigrant parents, experiencing the drudgery of going to a weekly religious service with none of the fun stuff, and experiencing all the fun stuff of a different religion without the drudgery. 

In middle school, I lived in Egypt which made me proud to be Muslim. The kids there were cool, hip even. It was normal. 

A year after I moved back to the states, 9/11 happened and I was thrown against the cold bathroom wall by a classmate accusing “my people&#8221; for being responsible for this terrorist attack. It&#8217;d possible he was joking, playfully fighting as high schoolers will do&#8230; but all I remember was his hands holding my wrists. 

I went through an intense period of atheism after that. I figured it didn&#8217;t make sense to follow rigid religions. I was free to make my own choices. I didn&#8217;t believe in God, and I didn&#8217;t pray. 

But it wasn&#8217;t fulfilling. It also didn&#8217;t help my relationships with non-atheists, with whom I would argue when the topic came up. I&#8217;d use what I called “logic” to dismantle their beliefs.

In my 30’s, I started to realize that these folks, most of them, were simply trying to live their lives, and that their religious beliefs were tools that helped them do that. 

And then I realized that I had my own tools. I was religious too, but I didn&#8217;t have a religion. 

My list of tools included:

  * zazen meditation 
  * good foof
  * music
  * fireflies
  * writing
  * songwriting
  * recording
  * lifting weights
  * reading
  * time and energy tracking

These daily routines enrich my life, gave me the ability to figure out my meaning and purpose. They still do. 

I don&#8217;t pray, but praying isn&#8217;t a requirement of religion. Neither is believing in a deity. I now say “I don&#8217;t know” with confidence but it is fun to process the fact that there are secrets in the universe that cannot be known. 

It all boils in a stew of wonder. That’s nourishment.
