Worry is a choice. And it&#8217;s one I choose quite a bit. No one has ever been successful with &#8220;don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; unless the initial worry was small.

Life&#8217;s anxieties have a way of attaching to the brain like a leech. Words and reassurances aren&#8217;t powerful enough to unstick or unseat that which has burrowed itself so deeply.

But the &#8220;you&#8221; that is under all of the thinking is _never_ worried. The observer, the true self, the Buddha mind, whatever you call it&#8230; doesn&#8217;t care a bit about your upcoming nerve wracking presentation at work.

The important lesson is not to abandon worry. But to realize that you carry the not-worried you wherever you go.
