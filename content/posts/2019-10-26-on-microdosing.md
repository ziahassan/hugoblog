You can overdose on almost anything: drugs, alcohol, talk radio, politics, religion. But there are fewer drugs that you can microdose on. 

Like the dolphin swimming 100 feet below you, you kind of have to sense the drug in your system, and how itâ€™s making you feel. In other words, you have to connect your body with your mind, which is so simple in concept and hard to do in practice.

Have you ever taken a drug that had no real side effects and tried to feel it work inside your body? Have you ever tried to feel yourself digest food? Have you tried to feel your heart pump blood?

This is why microdosing could be valuable: you can sharpen your sense of deep and subtle sensations and vibrations. 

You can expand your mind just by trying to notice its presence.
