I used to tell potential clients that I'm a life coach who specializes in careers.

I don't say that anymore. It tends to confuse people. 

And yet, it's still true. If you ever work with a career coach who doesn't understand life coaching, you're wasting your time and money.

Every job, every pivot, and every bullet on your resume is a little slice of your life. 

Each element of your job search needs reflection, feedback, and iteraton.

There just isn't any way around it.

It's not the job application process that hinders people. 

It's the hesitation, the second-guessing, the self-doubt, the sabotaging thoughts. 

It's a lack of momentum and accountability.

There's nothing wrong with hiring a resume writer or a career counselor. They'll tell you exactly what _they think_ you should do.

But ultimately, this structure falls apart. They aren't you. They don't necessarily share your values, your worldview, and your life goals. 

The most important gift a career coach can give their client?

Trust.
