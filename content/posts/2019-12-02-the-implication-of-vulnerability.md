Brene Brown has said that our ability to be vulnerable unblocks us, and heals our wounds. The idea is that if we are open with each other, if we can feel safe and shameless, we can be more productive in our personal and professional relationships.

But there&#8217;s an underlying current to vulnerability that is subtle at first: the idea of vulnerability implies that every single person experiences self-doubt and to some degree, is insecure.

Vulnerability, then, could be the acknowledgment of this very common feature of the human experience. That we are all unsure, trying to make sense of a sea of uncertainty. And if we simply recognize this as a shared experience, we&#8217;d all improve the quality of our life here in the universe.
