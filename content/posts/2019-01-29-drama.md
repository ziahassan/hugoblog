The rain in Orlando is ripping through the palm trees, like footage from a hurricane on TV. 

Only it&#8217;s just a normal storm. It&#8217;s over in an hour. I watch it end from the window of my hotel. 

Palm trees are more dramatic than even the ocean or the clouds. And whether it&#8217;s MTV or Netflix or the 9 oâ€™clock news, TV is merely a window for drama. 

Like the wind beneath this plane right now. Drama, at least on the receiving end. Natural otherwise. 

I hate drama. But that is dramatic. And to be honest, I love drama. 

Nothing lasts forever is drama. Things that are the way you don&#8217;t want them to be is drama. The way I react so viscerally to just the very idea that my expectations did not meet reality, that&#8217;s drama. 

I love all of it, and I loathe all of it too.
