As I plan for my upcoming course, I keep thinking about what qualities make up the best classes. One of the most important creative qualities that we can cultivate in a class of students is vulnerability. 

I’ve always felt somewhat vulnerable, in life. Sometimes to my detriment. Other times, it’s helped with whatever I’m doing, especially if what I’m doing is something creative. 

The assumption behind vulnerability is that you’re not the only one that has insecurities and fears; that everyone has these, and instead of working really hard to hide all of the rough stuff, we acknowledge that fear of being misunderstood is part of the human experience. When the walls of protectiveness fall away, we can be collaborative, productive, and kind.
