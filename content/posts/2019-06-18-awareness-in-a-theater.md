The other night, I had the pleasure of seeing one of my best friends on stage on at the Kennedy Center. The show he was in was a really interesting piece, full of wonder and introspection. 

During some of the more abstract moments, I found myself becoming aware, like I would in sitting meditation. All senses just scanning the dark room, directing my attention to each one: the faint stream of air from the conditioner, the stage lights creating a mist in the air&#8230;

And then I started tuning in to the sounds of the theater. Not just the music on stage but what was being “played” all around me. In a John Cage way, I started hearing the audience themselves. Rustling in their purses, chewing on a piece of gum, coughing, sighing, squeaking as they shifted in their chairs. 

_Has all this noise been here the whole time?_

It had, and my brain was filtering it out like sand through a comb. It&#8217;d be hard to enjoy a show in that state, so I quickly redirected my attention to the stage. 

But in that moment, I noticed how easily awareness can come. I flipped a switch, and there it was, in a crowded theater audience, who were intently wrapped in a musical. 

The number of entry points to awareness never fail to amaze me.
