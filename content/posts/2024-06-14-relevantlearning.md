One of the hardest things to do as a teacher is make the learning relevant for students.

This is somewhat easier when I teach a college class than it was when I taught K12, but many students take a class just for credit and aren't really invested in the skills.

Part of this reinvention process will be getting students to understand and leverage their strengths effectively. This means letting go of the reigns and letting students decide the ways in which they want to be assessed and how they want to practice their skills.

This is easier said than done. It's going to take a lot of good, deep thinking on how to do this on a systemic level.
