You&#8217;ve felt this way before: moderately stressed, such as a sports performance or a high stakes test. Youâ€™ve also felt stress-free, such as on vacation.

For a few years now, I&#8217;ve kept myself in the moderately stressed zone. I find it works best for me, and I&#8217;d guess many of my friends would relate. When my systems for productivity and wellness get pushed to their limits, I&#8217;m always excited to see that I can handle more than I thought.

But &#8211; and this happens in a split second &#8211; another unexpected event happens, like I need to leave unexpectedly late at night for a work event because I waited till the last minute to check the address and it&#8217;s too far away for a morning commute. Something like that.

And now I&#8217;m over-stressed. Any extra thing feels like it weighs a million pounds and it&#8217;s hard to know when the next moment of reprieve will come.

It happens so fast, going from perfectly stressed to overly stressed.

Perhaps I need to pay attention to the feeling I feel right before the tipping point. Perhaps that&#8217;s my cue for a margarita. Which will make me feel like I&#8217;m being lazy. Which will make me stressed of course.
