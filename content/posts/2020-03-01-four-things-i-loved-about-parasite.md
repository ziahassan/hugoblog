1. When things get gory toward the end. I’m not a fan of gratuitous violence really, even though I do love most of the Tarantino movies. A good story really makes the violence seem necessary to move the plot forward, and in this case, it worked.

2. The father and son communicating via morse code at the end, as well as the inclusion of morse code in general.

3. The scene where the family camps out in the mansion while the owners are away. The pacing here, the level of escalation per moment, was extraordinary.

4. I loved the way it’s hard to pin down exactly what genre this movie fits in. It was hilarious and sad and scary and horrific and joyful all in one go. Will definitely watch again.
