Tomorrow is New Years Day, but only because we call it that, only because we decided that this is when the “new year” would begin.

But these words like time and years are just constructs.You can have a “new year” anytime you’d like.

The reason why a new year’s resolution can be functional is not because of the clocks changing from 2019 to 2020, but because in this two-week lull of winter break, everything is partially shut down. Work, school, and other activities are usually off. 

It’s the best time to _start_ your new habits, _before_ the new year begins. Put together your fitness or nutrition plan. Start to learn the motions, start to cook small things at home. When the new year arrives, the habit will already be there in a small way and it can grow.
