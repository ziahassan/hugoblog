When it comes to creativity, we can either assess the person creating or the creation itself.

It might make more sense to judge the creation when the creator does not need formative feedback in the same way that a student would.

I probably won't critique Thom Yorke if I don't like a Radiohead album. There's not much utility in that. But I will critique the album, so others can know whether or not to avoid it.

But when assessing someone like a student, it makes a whole lot more sense to assess them as a person.

What are their creative habits? How do they get out of their own way to ideate? How do they keep their analytical inner critique at bay until the right moment?
