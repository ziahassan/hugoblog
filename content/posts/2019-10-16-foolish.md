When I created this blog, I thought I would import all of my old blog posts to make this archive comprehensive. I’ve been writing since 2001 (Livejournal), so I have a lot of posts backed up. While I haven’t written daily until just a few years ago, I went through stints of writing in my blog every few months or years.

When I imported all of my old posts, some written when I was just 15 years old, I cringed. What an idiot, I thought. How foolish. I made the posts hidden immediately. 

And then a new, even more unnerving thought: what if I read _my current_ posts in 20 years? Will I call myself a fool?

I hope not. I hope I remember that wisdom accumulates, and that this writing represents a certain temporal location, a certain point in existence, and therefore it’s just about as perfect as anything else in the world.
