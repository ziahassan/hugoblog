yup just what the subject says. I cannot believe i'm doing this. this is crazy.

at first I was totally opposed to the idea of having the events in my life posted in an online journal. but I needed something, something to rant to and tell all my problems with the possibility of losing them as a friend or something.

so what am I supposed to write about? i've never tried to keep a journal before. well yeah I did. I bought one of those fancy books with the lock and everything, and the hidden key in the spine and stuff. it was phat but then I never wrote in it. that was a kid phase though. a kid thing.

today is the day after hit parade. hit parade is the big musical extravaganza, with a buncha musical numbers and stuff. it was fun and tonight's gonna be even better. fucking come to the show if your not in it. no one's really gonna read this unless they're in it anyway. I think.

boy what a mess I had to go through to get here. I coudln't get into this because I needed some user code, so then I signed up for dead journal. Dead journal, as it says on their site, is "not filled with fruitcakes and flowers." I probably woudln't belong there, but I didn't need any freakin user code so it was fine. and so then I got a user code from my friend sami, and now I'm here. I think it's fuckin awesome how I can make the posts public or keep em to myself. and this little program I downloaded makes it easier, so I don't have to get onto the web everytime to use the damn thing. gotta love new technology.

you probably won't hear too many big problems coming from me in this journal, those'll be in different entries, private ones. I just don't feel like dealing with any people's qualms.

so where to start. my performance last night was ok. I felt good about most of it, although I screwed up a lot in a lot of places.

So this is cool. it's like i'm writing letters to everyone in the entire world. actually, one big letter for everyone.

Right now i'm not diggin my life too much. I feel kind of alone. But fuck it you do too, so I shoudln't be complaining. Alone in the sense that no one really gives a shit about the stuff that I give a shit about. you get what i'm saying. duncan sheik does too, he's playing on my stereo right now, and he totally understands. buy his album "humming." It really is a work of art. As are of all of his albums. I love John Mayer, and I think he's a phenomenal songwriter. John can move my heart for sure. But Duncan Sheik is someone I truly consider to be a true artist, and also a musical genius. Duncan can move my soul, which is something John still hasn't done. I would recommend Room For Squares to anyone, but for anyone who feels like I do right now, Duncan Sheik is the way to go.

"she figures it's the only way to keep herself together. something about a hotel room and horses. and losing all her friends, and hearing all their voices. she rubs it out, she covers it over. she's stronger by far than a war torn soldier. she rubs it out&#8230;"

my mom won't stop shouting. i'm sure you all understand what this is like. it's like, the most annoying voice you could possibly put together. pj showed me this www.creatafart.com thing where you could design your own personalized fart. well, if there was a www.createanannoyingvoice.com then my mom would be the voice blasting through my loud speakers and into my ears, AS LOUD AS POSSIBLE. oo there's a "detect music now" button on this window. Should I click it? what'll happen? i'm nervous, here goes&#8230; nothing happened

"sometime ago, I thought that she was trying to move on, I thought wrong"

get that song. rubbed out, by duncan sheik. my room's a mess, I probably need to clean it up soon. actually it's not that bad.

ok I'm done for now.
