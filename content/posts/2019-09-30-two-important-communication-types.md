You could split communication into about a million cross sections. Here are a couple that are worth mentioning. 

  1. Direct communication: when you say what you mean, using economy of language (as few words as possible to clearly communicate a point). 
  2. Responsive Communication: when you say what you mean, but you frame it in the context of the human needs of love and acceptance. Along with your “point” is also empathy, understanding, and acceptance of the other person. 

Some have tried to argue that the second type is too flowery, too sugar coated. I would argue that it&#8217;s a necessary way to truly communicate anything that important. You can&#8217;t remove human needs and emotions from any communication, even at work. It&#8217;s essential to consider these needs in every interaction if you want to make a difference or change someone&#8217;s perspective.
