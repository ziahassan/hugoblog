I was with someone the other day that I didn’t know very well. I asked them how they were doing, and they said “ah, you know, the days are long the years are short.”

It stuck with me. It’s such an interesting problem: on one hand, it’s scary how quickly the years seem to fly by, but the day can stretch out, hour by hour, seemingly forever. 

In this way, perhaps, life is short but also wide. The century or so that we’re here can go by in a flash, but living in the present moment can keep us grounded in our day-to-day life. The best part of it all is that the day’s are already long, we could just choose to enjoy the lengthiness… and then perhaps the years won’t seem as short.
