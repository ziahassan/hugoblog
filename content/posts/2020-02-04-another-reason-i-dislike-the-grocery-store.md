The items that are eye level were put there by marketers who paid extra to have their items at eye level.

It&#8217;s a subtle manipulation but an important one: we don&#8217;t pick our food, our food (and its makers) pick us. Unless we actively go out of our way to avoid the manipulation, like people who only shop at Farmers markets.

It&#8217;s not the only capitalist-style manipulation in my life. The internet seems to morphing into one huge manipulation, for instance.

But it is an important one. The way we choose the products that go into our body could be up to us and not subject to marketing money and psychological manipulation.
