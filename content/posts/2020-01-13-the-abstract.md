Have you ever gone to a museum for abstract art? And have you ever wondered what you’re looking at? Why it sells?

There’s a classic meme of someone looking at a big white frame that an artist left intentionally blank, and it has a price tag of $1000. 

Then there’s also the case of abstract math. This is what teachers mean when they teach things like 7-2, without any context or real world application.

What it makes us realize is that these numbers are symbols, just like art pieces, that encourage the _participant _to determine meaning. The symbol 7 only means seven whole units because we decided it would. The white frame only represents heaven because we decided it did.
