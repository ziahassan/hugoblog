I&#8217;m fascinated by environments that contain tiny little worlds. Places like restaurants, where each booth contains a different group of oeople, a different story, one that is entirely different from the story of those in the booth just one over.

College dorms are like this too, except a little more specialized. Take a bunch of people who were children yesterday and expected to be adults today, pair them up with another random person in the same situation, and see what happens. Each form has _two_ tiny worlds inside. Sometimes the split is visible when you look inside. 

This is why freshman year is such a magical time. For the first time ever, we can travel to strange, random, and freshly created worlds just by cruising down the hallway.
