**Giving in** is to succumb to internal desire or fear. You might give in to your kid’s demands for waffles for dinner because you&#8217;re fearful that he might have a tantrum. Or you might give in to the desire to eat an entire chocolate cake at 2am on a Tuesday. Giving in means you&#8217;ve surrendered to your reptilian brain in some way. It&#8217;s hard to control giving in. 

**Giving out** is to succumb to external forces. Your arms can give out when you can no longer carry a heavy object. A house’s roof can give out in an intense storm. It&#8217;s hard to control giving out. 

**Giving up** is to succumb to the internal voice in your head, the one telling you that you&#8217;re unworthy or less powerful than you are. Giving up requires a chain of thought. It is a choice. 

Giving up is what happens when giving in causes giving out. Giving up is the final step in the process of devaluing yourself. 

Stand strong.
