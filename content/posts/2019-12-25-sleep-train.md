Putting a child to bed is one of the most fascinating experiences of parenthood so far.

I&#8217;ve never thought about where one actually _goes_ when they go to sleep, not since I was a child. But my son will cry and whimper and cling when I put him down until, all of a sudden, sleep has whisked him away to its magical land of dreams and replenishment.

It&#8217;s almost as if there&#8217;s a sleep train, and you have to be at the station (bed) on time in order to catch it. Those times where we end up putting him down too late or too early means he doesn&#8217;t catch the train with as much ease.

But where does the train go for hours? What journeys does he take? Are they like mine? I guess I&#8217;ll never know since I barely know where _I_ go.

Still, it&#8217;s fun to wonder.
