Seeing is the act of processing visual information. Seeing isn’t judging. It’s natural for most people.

Looking is a type of seeking. When we look for things, we’re filtering out information to find exactly what we need.

Observing is a type of information gathering. We observe to collect data for later analysis.

Different types of eye functions for different situations. You need to see when you’re driving. You need to look when you’re at the grocery store. And you need to observe when you’re solving complex problems, like how to get your kid to get to sleep.

Which one do you do the most of the time? What’s your balance like? And how can you use these distinctions to optimize functionality?
