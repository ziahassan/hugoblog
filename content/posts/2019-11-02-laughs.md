I’ve been fascinated by people’s laughs since I was young. Almost like an audio fingerprint, a person’s laugh is perfectly customized to who they are. Even when they have a laugh you weren’t expecting (say, a very large man with a high pitched giggle), the laugh still seems to “capture” a person’s spirit in a simple sound.

I’ve also noticed how my own laugh changes. When I was a kid, it was a full loud belly laugh. When I became a teenager, I had more of a gasping sort of laugh. A few years ago, it was a high pitched “HAH HAH.” I still get that one if I’m really laughing.

Sometimes I wish I could map out how my laugh has shifted and evolved, and perhaps compare it to what was going on in my life at the time, who I was friends with, and what I found funny. It’d be an interesting study.

Laughs shift subtly just like platectonics. But so does a person’s smile, touch, tastes, and almost everything else.
