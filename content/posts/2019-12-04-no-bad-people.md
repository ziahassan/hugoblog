“They’re just an asshole,” she says to me in the car on the way home.

“Nobody is &#8216;just an asshole&#8217;,” I reply. I have no idea where that came from, and I have no idea why I’m being defensive over someone I don’t even know, but there it is.

Suddenly, out of nowhere, I have a new life rule: there are no bad people. Controversial, but when you really think about it, hard to argue.

“Everyone acts from a place of joy or fear,” I tell her. “So being an asshole is just a mode of operating, of picking fear. But it&#8217;s not someone’s identity.&#8221;

“I don’t think that’s right. What about Hitler?&#8221;

“Fearful.”

The rest of the ride is silent. It’s hard to know if what I said was the right thing or the wrong thing.
