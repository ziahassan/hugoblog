When people argue, there’s a tendency to be polite, and to say “yeah exactly!”

It happens even when we disagree. “Yeah, exactly! But…&#8221;

Maybe it’s important to vehemently disagree or agree in a conversation with opinions. If this becomes common practice, we will eventually work ourselves out of the idea of wanting to be agreeable and likeable and safe all the time.

There’s nothing wrong with being agreeable of course, but it may be unhealthy to do it for the wrong reasons. We don’t sit down and talk about our opinions just to restate the opinions we’ve already formed (that’s what social media is for). We do it to change, to come to agreements, to develop new ideas that could never have happened in isolation.

After all, it’s the inter_change_ that makes _change _happen.
