A sign in a Minneapolis parking garage simply says “watch and wait.”

The context of course is that people might be walking by, and we don&#8217;t want them to get hit by cars&#8230; so watch and wait, and then exit safely.

But I love taking signs like these out of context and thinking about how they might apply to other parts of life.

For instance, when I became a parent, a piece of advice I was given was: whatever new parent stuff you&#8217;re anxious about, you won&#8217;t be anxious about it in two weeks. But you&#8217;ll be anxious about something else. Watch and wait.

Or when I get really upset about a current life situation, my wife always says to me: _this too shall pass._ And it helps. Watch and wait.

I want to be clear: I don&#8217;t believe we should spend our lives just watching and waiting. There&#8217;s an unspoken third step: decide.

No, not to _act_, necessarily, just to _decide_.

Sometimes I decide to let go of whatever I am watching and waiting. It&#8217;s a simple but conscious decision and it provides finality to what could be an endless loop of anxiety.

Sometimes I decide to ponder more. Another simple decision that defers my thinking to a later time, when I can write out a solution.

And other times, I decide to act right away. This used to be my default, and in fact it was the only way I knew how to proceed. It didn&#8217;t always work out, understandably. Sometimes pondering or letting go would have been better choices.

But regardless of what decisions I make, the first two steps always remain the same: watch and wait.
