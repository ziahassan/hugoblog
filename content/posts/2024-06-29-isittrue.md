I have a history of anxiety.

I've never been formally diagnosed, but I worry and catastrophize quite a bit.

I heard someone once say that a good question to ask in a moment of anxiety is...

_Is it true?_

Whatever it is that you're catastrophizing, whatever belief you're holding that is weighing you down...

Is it really true?

Can you know beyond a shadow of a doubt?

Often, the answer to this question is no.

It's more like our mind is playing tricks on us.

In the first week of Kindergarten, my son developed benign polyuria, which means you feel the need to pee constantly. 

I told him it was his brain playing tricks on him, and after a little while, the symptoms went away.

How many of our symptoms, I wonder, occur because we believe things that are untrue?
