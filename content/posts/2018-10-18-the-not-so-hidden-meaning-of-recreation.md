Recreation is a word to which we’ve assigned a cultural meaning. It usually indicates fun or leisurely activities. Recreation centers are places to relax and exercise. In some schools, it has replaced the word “recess.”

But recreation, or the act of _re-creation_, might give us more than what we’ve taken from the word. 

There are many ways to re-create one’s self. Play, something that usually happens during re-creation, can sometimes allow for healing and rebuilding. Exercise and stress release, stuff you’d find in a “rec” center, also serve the same purpose.

Ever since I realized this not so hidden meaning, I try to re-create myself a little every time I do something recreational.
