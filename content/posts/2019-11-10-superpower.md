The _super_ part of superpower means power that others do not have.

We, the collective consciousness, have infinite power between us. It&#8217;s essential to know what your superpower is, what you contribute to the universe.

It&#8217;s probably not what your parents told you it is, or what you studied in college (though it might be).

It might not be something for which you will ever be paid.

It might be compassion, generosity, or making nourishing food.

The point is it&#8217;s yours (and yours alone) to find.
