This semester is sort of taunting me. Normally I can sit in my classes and after the first week, have an idea of how horrible it&apos;s going to be. With this current semester, I have absolutely no clue. I&apos;m sure that will change soon, but who knows. What&apos;s nice is that I won&apos;t have work for another couple of days. I wouldn&apos;t say this job is stressful, but it&apos;s high tension. Like&#8230; something _could_ go wrong, but I&apos;ve had good luck. 

So I&apos;ve moved even farther away from the pretty desktop features, and moved to a windows manager that&apos;s entirely keyboard activated. I hardly touch the mouse anymore, because my mp3 player and AIM are all keyboard activated too. It&apos;s really awesome, every window takes up the full screen, but I can set it up so that it goes into a split screen mode. The writer musta really hated his mouse because it&apos;s called ratpoison. As in, killing the rodent. I originally thought I&apos;d end up hating it, but it&apos;s lightning fast and really efficient.

I played poker with the guys and lost horribly. But I was never a competitive guy. It doesn&apos;t really matter.

Edited cause i fixed the pictures.
