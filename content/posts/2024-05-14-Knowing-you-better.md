There are three steps if you want to truly be in someone's corner:

1. Become endlessly curious about their lives. Don't tell them why you like their work; ask them what makes it important.
2. See their flaws as human; believe in their full potential. This makes you less critical and judgy. It helps you see everyone as incredible human beings who sometimes get in their own way.
3. Tell them the truth. With love.
