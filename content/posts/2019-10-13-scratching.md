“Don’t scratch your itch,” my mom would say when I got a bug bite as a child. “It’ll make it worse. Let the medicine do its work.”

The medicine could be anti-histamine, music, or Advil. But we refuse, don’t we, just to let the medicine do its work. We’d rather scratch because it _feels satisfying_ than sit with our discomfort, keep our hands off of it, and let it evaporate.

Maybe one of the most important lessons I never learned was this: if you don’t scratch your itches, external or spiritual, the medicine will do its work.
