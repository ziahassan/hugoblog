Have you ever written an angry email? Have you ever received one?

To be on either end of the exchange is stressful. On the receiving end, you read someone else&#8217;s scathing words with no opportunity to immediately respond. Like having your mouth stuffed with a cloth while someone circles you and berates you.

And when you&#8217;re writing an angry email, you&#8217;re processing your feelings. There&#8217;s a reason you chose email as a form of communication over a phone call or an in-person meeting, which is that it&#8217;s easier to call someone out when they can&#8217;t respond easily.

I once wrote an angry email to my doctor. He had falsely diagnosed with me a pretty serious disease, and it had affected my life and given me a fear of doctors and medicine. His misdiagnosis was so incredibly irresponsible (it was based on a single blood test, that ended up being erroneous) and I had nightmares about him, and the situation, for weeks. I was so angry.

So I decided, one day at work, to tell him how his actions had affected me. I wrote a very lengthy email, telling him how irresponsible his diagnosis was, how I&#8217;d never come to his practice again, and how he needs to think about his practice critically when he works with other patients.

I wrote the entire 5 paragraph email on my lunch break and read it back to myself. As I read through it, I realized that through the process of simply writing this email, I had healed myself (or started to heal myself). It wasn&#8217;t that I needed him to know anything at all, because it wouldn&#8217;t make a difference probably. I needed to let _myself_ know how I felt. That was all.

I never sent the email, but I did save it as a draft.

It&#8217;s a strategy I recommend for anyone who has anger toward another person. Write them a letter, but don&#8217;t send it. The process of writing is self-healing, much more than the other person experiencing your anger.
