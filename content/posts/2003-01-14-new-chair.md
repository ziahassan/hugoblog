Today was a pretty interesting day. Once again I had that weird feeling in my gut that something was wrong. Christine tried to convince me it's just the end of the semester blues. It should all go away once the craziness is gone in a couple of days.

I have a math quiz tommorow and I don't know a single thing. Some would say that I'm screwed. I shut off the vent in my house and it is still freezing cold.

I got a new chair today, it's nice and leathery. I really need to finish my math. I'll write more tommorow as I have some stuff to write about. Now just isn't a good time.
