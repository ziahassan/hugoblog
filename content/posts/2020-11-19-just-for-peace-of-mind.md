It’s almost an add on, sometimes. Wipe the swings down, _just for peace of mind._ Get your locks changed, _just for peace of mind._ Pay for this life insurance, _just for peace of mind._

It’s not just nice to have. We can act for peace of mind so that we don’t have to be low-grade anxious about unlikely and unwanted circumstances.

For me, peace of mind is a priority.
