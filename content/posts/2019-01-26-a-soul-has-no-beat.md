The thing about a calling is that it&#8217;s really easy to ignore. There are people that go their whole lives without hearing it, despite how _loud_ it can call. 

I remember the urge, when I was three, to tell people how to do things. Perhaps it was a bit bossy, but the fact that I&#8217;m now an educator isn&#8217;t surprising in retrospect. And the fact that even before I was an educator, teaching was the part of my consulting job I connected to the most. 

I made up songs in the shower since age 6, and am still a working singer songwriter. The ability to mystify using magic was the start of my passion for storytelling. 

But I didn&#8217;t hear these callings, not until later. And itâ€™s possible I would&#8217;ve never heard them at all, if it weren&#8217;t for my mentors. That&#8217;s the value of a mentor; getting the mentee to tune in, to listen to the calling coming from their own soul. 

I guess the soul is the thing that is hardest to hear. 

It doesn&#8217;t beat like a heart. 

It whispers like a stream.
