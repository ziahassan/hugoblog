I can get generative AI to write a sonnet in the voice of Brene Brown.  
  
But it won’t have any [social or cultural context](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003233930-12/creative-articulation-jonathan-plucker) for this outside of its training on human-written text.  
  
I can get to write a screenplay that sounds like Aaron Sorkin. But it will move no one.  
  
Or I can get it to write a song that sounds like Taylor Swift, but it won’t wrench my heart.  
  
It can create, but it cannot be creative.
