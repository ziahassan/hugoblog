So many ads, when they state the price of the thing they&#8217;re selling, follow it with “that&#8217;s the price of a cup of coffee!”

What this trope is supposed to illuminate is the idea that the product being sold is affordable, and we mindlessly spend that much on other things anyway.

A cup of coffee?

What kind of coffee are we taking? A latte? Lattes are pretty expensive.

&#8230;what size? A smaller size is significantly less expensive.

Store bought or made at home? The coffee I make at home is probably less than a dollar per cup.

And the final truth after thinking it all through is that I actually didn&#8217;t need that coffee to begin with.
