I’ve managed to live in 2019 without watching Game of Thrones, one of the most popular TV shows among my peer group. 

It’s not that I’m avoiding the show; I just never got into it. 

On the flip side, it’s hard for me to imagine how _anyone_ could live without having seen Breaking Bad, Six Feet Under, and Buffy. Those shows have transformed me, and I can’t imagine what would life would be like if I hadn’t watched and thought about them.

Of course, life would be just fine without some of the shows. Transformation happens anyway, and it’s likely that some other piece of art would changed me in a different way if those shows hadn’t made their way into my life.

Turns out transformation isn’t something you can prevent or stimulate. One day you’re _this_, and the next day you’re _that_.
