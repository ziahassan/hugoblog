The first time I stayed up all night it was New Years Eve, and I was eleven. I just wanted to see what would happen. It was the end of the rainbow. I was curious what would happen I stayed up all night. So hour by hour, I eventually got to the end. The sun rose and I hadn’t missed anything.

The end of the rainbow is also useful when trying to lose weight. You eat a salad for lunch one day and think to yourself, _ah, that wasn’t so hard. What if I do that every day?_ So you eat it the next day and the day after that. And then one day your pants are three sizes smaller and everyone in the office is giving you compliments. End of the rainbow.

It’s a great way to advance in your career, too. What would happen if you really gave this routine sales presentation my all? And the next day? And the next? Until one day you’re the CEO. End of the rainbow.

Realizing a dream isn’t something that happens randomly one day. You make it happen by walking until we get to the bitter end.

And then you find a new rainbow to hike.
