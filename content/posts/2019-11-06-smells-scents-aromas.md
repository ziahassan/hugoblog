A smell is defined, roughly, as the process by which your nose detects a scent and sends it to your brain for processing. It&#8217;s one of those special powers we have as animals.

A scent is a characteristic smell. You&#8217;d know if it you smelled it again. Scents are things like asparagus, rubber, and coffee.

An aroma is typically a pleasant scent. Whereas the scent classification would apply to a skunk odor, an aroma is a positive experience. Aromas are fresh fall leaves, Christmas, a fireplace, the cold night air.

These aren&#8217;t separate things. All three are layers of the same idea, an almost indescribable olfactory sensation that creeps into our brain and reminds us that we&#8217;re present.
