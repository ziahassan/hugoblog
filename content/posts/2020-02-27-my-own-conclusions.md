There are those in my friend group who I would describe as best friends. If I had to identify one common thread that links them together, it is that they are all really good at _letting me arrive at my own conclusions._

This is something I value in a friendship, and it’s also something I try to instill in my own life as a trainer, consultant, and college professor. 

That said, it is very hard sometimes to _not _give advice. Especially for me, as my natural instinct has traditionally to “fix” problems. It might be related to my love of technology (problems that _can_ be solved). But I also have developed of the human psyche, which presents problems that may never be solved, but can be explored, interrogated, and transformed.
