I have a very keen ear. I hear things going on outside of my house even when the windows are closed.

What I heard recently on a late summer night was an echoey, old-timey voice, coming from a nearby house. I opened the window to get a better understanding of what I was hearing: it was the audio from the commentators on an old baseball game. Someone must have been streaming it from YouTube or something, and blasting it through the neighborhood.

Right as I opened the window, I heard the announcer say “Please exit the stadium carefully and drive safely.&#8221;

Who was experiencing this little piece of nostalgia? And why had they blasted it so loudly in my neighborhood? 

And most importantly, what did they need?
