I studied marketing in college, and we studied it the right way. We were taught how to adjust product, price, and brand to meet the demands of a segment of the market.

But then I started reading about marketing online and most of the content was about how to get a higher search result on Google, how to increase follower count, how to &#8220;hustle&#8221; and make money, and a bunch of other to-dos that are more about having bragging rights than they are about marketing. 

One of those to-dos is to create a sense of urgency. You see this tactic being used when there&#8217;s a sign that says the sale ends in 24 hours. Infomercials use it to when they say _call in the next 20 minutes for a free thing!_

It&#8217;s harder to create urgency when someone is a door-to-door marketer, unless you repair roof shingles. A few roof repair companies in the area have stopped by my house to tell me that my roof is falling apart, and it just so happens they&#8217;re in my area and can give me a free estimate. I hate it and I never do anything but the shut the door on these people.

But another time I was in the Ikea parking lot, and a guy drove up and offered to remove the dents from my car while I was shopping. I declined, but I&#8217;ve thought about it for years. How simple it would have been to just pay him $100 to come back to a dent-free car. No need to make an appointment at the mechanic or spend extra time on it. It was great marketing: there&#8217;s a guy with a dented car, and someone who fixes that exact problem.

So now I aspire to be that type of person who has the exact solution for an exact problem. Forget about jobs, careers, promotions, raises&#8230; if I can be this type of person, then perhaps a lot of other pieces will fall into place, naturally.
