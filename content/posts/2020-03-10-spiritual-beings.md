I was in a lecture recently where someone referenced this quote: “We are not human beings having a spiritual experience; we are spiritual beings having a human experience.&#8221;

I like this interpretation. For me, a spiritual being is the person you are now, but also the person you were before you were born, and the person you’ll be after you die. Maybe person isn’t even the right word.

There’s a lineage through it all, a thread. The thing that connects me to my ancestors and that connects my future children, great grandchildren and so on, all the way back to me in the present moment. 

All of that exists at all times, in some form of energy.
