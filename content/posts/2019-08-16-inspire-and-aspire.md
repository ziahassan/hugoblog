When the muse hits us, when we come up with a stroke of genius, we often describe the feeling as _inspiration_.

Inspire literally means to breathe something in. We see something in culture that we take in, that finds its way into the crevices in our bones, that changes our brain chemistry (even a little).

We say “I’ve been inspired” when that happens.

But what happens next is the action we take, the book we write, the song we compose, And that is when we aspire, which literally means to breathe out.

Life is composed of this in/out breath, literally. And creating art is what we _must_ do when we’re inspired, or else we might _expire_.
