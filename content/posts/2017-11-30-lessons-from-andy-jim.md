I recently watched this documentary called Andy & Jim about how Jim Carey basically assumed, full-time, the spirit/zeitgeist of Andy Kaufman/Bob Clifton in the outstanding movie _Man on the Moon_.

But doing so required that I first re-watch _Man on the Moon_, which I hadn&#8217;t seen since it came out in 18 years ago. 

Both movies, interestingly, are centered around creative struggle, expression, innovation, and the undeniable connection between sadness and humor.

5 thoughts from the movie:

  1. Truly innovative art spurs haters.
  2. Truly innovative art touches souls.
  3. Reggie Watt&#8217;s Twitter bio, for the longest time, has said &#8220;In the absence of truth there is confusion; the essence of truth.&#8221; The essence of something is more magical, more spiritual, than a direct connection to that something.
  4. Being firm in your convictions means a lot of people will misunderstand.
  5. Psychological Halloweenism (assuming someone else&#8217;s persona) can be addictive.
