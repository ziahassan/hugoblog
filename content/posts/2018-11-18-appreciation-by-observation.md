Want to appreciate a moment? Write down the sensory details. 

Want to appreciate a person? Write them a love letter. 

Want to appreciate a piece of art? Say how it makes you feel, regardless of whether it&#8217;s positive or negative.

Want to appreciate your kids? Watch them play. 

Want to appreciate a friendâ€™s work? Gush over it, as sincerely as you can. 

Appreciation is the art of noticing the value that other entities bring to your life and the lives of those around you. 

It&#8217;s a matter of intention and thought trains, not simple acts of kindness or service. 

Not all things deserve appreciation, but it&#8217;s more than you think.
