There are certain inflections, certain tones that a person uses when they say certain phrases.

I enjoy these when I hear them. The slang phrases people use and the perfectly predictable intonation and cadence they use while saying them.

I want to tell them how much I appreciate this about them, but itâ€™s a bit like popping a soap bubble: the act of pointing it out causes consciousness, and along with consciousness comes the tendency to self-edit.
