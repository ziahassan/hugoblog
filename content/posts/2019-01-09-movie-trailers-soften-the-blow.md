I used to love movie trailers as a kid. 

So much that I&#8217;d be upset if I was late and missed even one of them. There was something magical to me about the telling of these mini-stories. I loved following up by seeing the movie advertised and would get excited when I&#8217;d notice a scene from the trailer and how it fit into the film. 

Until it all changed one day, when I saw the movie Room. I won&#8217;t say what it&#8217;s about to avoid spoilers and also because it doesn&#8217;t matter what it was about. What made the experience of Room different for me was that I _didnt see the trailer_. In fact, I hadn&#8217;t heard or watched anything about it, despite the fact that it was based on a book. 

If you&#8217;ve seen the film, then you know just how jarring that must have been. It was the most unbelievable experience. I was literally on the edge of my seat. I had _zero_ idea what I was in for. If I had, the blow would&#8217;ve been softened. And I don&#8217;t want soft blows when it comes to movies. 

Since then, I&#8217;ve realized that all trailers do essentially the same thing: they tell the story of the movie, with most of the key scenes, and leave out the ending. Good thing, because otherwise there&#8217;d be no need to see the film. 

But if a movie requires 2 hours to tell a story and previews are able to condense the story into 2 mins to entice viewers to see it, then aren&#8217;t we being exposed to elements of s story without the details? And doesn&#8217;t that affect how we receive the movie when we watch it for the first time?

I&#8217;m not saying we should do away with trailers. One great trailer was for the Man on Wire movie, which simply showed the character high up on a skyscraper, about to walk across a tightrope. But then, that was a bio pic, so not much “story” was needed to entice viewers. Imagine doing the same idea but for a rom com. Not as effective. 

It would make more sense, perhaps, to just share a one min scene from the movie. This is maybe less enticing, but with a good movie, this could be effective in drawing in viewers _and_ not give it all away. Imagine seeing just the first scene of Up for instance. It&#8217;s enough to make you want to stay for the rest. It&#8217;s a radical idea, but the current style of movie trailers can ruin the experience of a truly good film by laying out the story structure in your mind before you actually see the movie.

We changed the style of previews once before by ditching narration. I say let&#8217;s do it again.
