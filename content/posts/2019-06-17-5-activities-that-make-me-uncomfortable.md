1. Watching someone do something on a computer knowing it could be done much more efficiently. 
  2. Someone finishing or starting their food after or before me (because of social meal-sync). 
  3. Watching someone get someone&#8217;s else&#8217;s name wrong&#8230; repeatedly. 
  4. Watching someone break an instrument. 
  5. Eating soggy cereal.
