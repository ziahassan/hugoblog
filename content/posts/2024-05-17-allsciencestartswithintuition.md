After all, what is a hypothesis if it isn't trying to prove an intuitive nudge?

My third-grade teacher would have me believe that is a hypothesis is basically an "educated guess," which is a good explanation for a third grader... but I'm starting to realize it's more than that.

Perhaps the science is the afterthought, a result that is enabled by an intuitive _nudge_.

Consider the Buddha, who clearly believed in the healing benefits of meditation long before the science caught up.

He intuitively felt that the practice of meditating was _so worthwhile_ that it spurred an entire religion and way of life.

Whenever a scientist wants to discover something, the path to this discovery doesn't come out of thin airâ€”it comes out of the scientist's interest, worldview, and internal sense of knowing.
