“That’s a nice trick, but it’s not _real _magic.&#8221;

Whenever I get this comment, I agree. And it makes me wonder, then, what _real magic_ looks like, and what this person is expecting.

I suppose it’s the unexplained phenomena in our lives… but is it “real&#8221; simply because it lacks an explanation? If that’s the case, then my tricks _are_ real magic.

Whether magic is real or not depends on the participant. When the universe manipulates itself it’s very much like when I manipulate a deck of cards in order to deceive someone. 

Everything depends on deception.
