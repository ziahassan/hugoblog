Today, I received a package in the mail that I’ve been waiting for since the new year started.

I wasn’t quite sure when it would arrive, and I checked the mail incessantly. There was no tracking number or notification service letting me know when it would be out for delivery.

Well, it arrived today. I nearly tackled the mailman. 

Inside of the package were four books, full of words that I’d already read… because I’d written them.

I&#8217;ve written before about my journaling habit. Ive been going online now for nine years, almost daily. I say almost because between 2010-2014, I wrote maybe 3-5 times a week. After that, it was daily. 

At first, I used email services like OhLife, that would email me every day asking how my day was. I would reply and my response would go into a private database, and the same email would also tell me what I wrote a year ago. 

Eventually, I wrote a script in Ruby that imported all of my entries into an app called DayOne, which also allowed me to add pictures. 

DayOne has the feature of being able to order a beautiful photo book that makes a beautiful display of photos and text. I ordered 4 books &#8211; 9 years of journal entries. And while these aren&#8217;t for the public, they give me exactly what I want &#8211; a lab notebook.

A lab notebook contains the objective observations of life. Not like this blog, which is full of analysis. My journal is just a list of things I did or things I feel. The very fragments of my mind, poured out onto paper. 

I read about my wedding, I read about my career changes (2 of them), I read about finding out my wife was pregnant. Then I read about my child being born and the days that followed. 

I saw how far I&#8217;ve come, and got a glimpse of where I&#8217;m headed (but only a glimpse). 

It&#8217;s a window and a mirror and a data sheet all in one.
