Diet trends are fascinating to watch. They come, they go, they morph and they reappear under different names.

A popular idea right now is that of intuitive eating. Rather than stick to calorie limits or re-balance macronutrients, the idea is simply that you listen to your body and stop eating when you’re full.

This is most likely the healthiest way to approach weight loss/healthy eating, once you understand what “full” means (many of us think of “full” as “stuffed.”) 

It’s interesting to watch my son engage with intuitive eating. He’s a ferocious eater and will usually take more food than most of his peers, but he knows when he’s done. And I know this because he says “done.” He could cry his face off for just one more spoonful of hummus (his current favorite) and then be “done.&#8221;

He doesn’t have to think about food after the food is done. He’s hungry and then he wants. He’s full and then he doesn’t.

I’d like to be more like him.
