Here is a continuum in which you have business (busy-ness) on one side and stillness on the other.

For so long, I was focused on the business part, and from looking at my various media feeds, it seems that the algorithms want to feed me this content as well.

But on the other hand, I crave stillness too. Of course I do, because too much busy-ness can become overwhelming.

Perhaps a good life goal is not to be productive all the time, or to hustle our way to freedom, whatever that means.

Perhaps itâ€™s finding the optimal balance of busy-ness vs. stillness. If one overpowers the other, we become disoriented.
