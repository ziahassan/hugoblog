If you ever feel awkward around your friend’s kids, but you don’t want to seem rude, just _be curious about whatever they’re_ _curious about._ 

If they’re face down on the floor in a comic book, ask who drew it. 

If they are pulling apart a paperclip, ask about what they’re building. 

Or better yet ask to build it with them.
