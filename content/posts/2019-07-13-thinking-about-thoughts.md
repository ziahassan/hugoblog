What came first? The thinking or the thoughts?

Do we have thoughts? Or do thoughts have us?

If it&#8217;s the latter, then thinking is a kind of cultivation, a gardening of the plants that emerged through a natural process.

But if, on the other hand, we do produce thoughts the same way we excrete waste or Co2, then we are magical creatures, built with superpowers even we do not understand.

&#8220;I think therefore I am&#8221; may be true, but could be revised to say that thinking _happens_ to those that exist, in the same way that growing happens to trees that exist.

Our nature is a duality: we are powerful in our powerlessness.
