The Untethered Soul is a wonderful book on spirituality by Michael Singer. Apparently it resides next to Oprah’s bed. Here are 3 things I learned.

1. Life will unfold, and the best we can do is to allow it to do so. The more we resist, the more we keep negative energy within us.

2. “The inner roommate” is a great way of referring to the monkey mind, the voice that speaks and tells us how worthless we are. We can transcend this voice by realizing that it isn’t us.

3. The real us is what lies behind the persona, the one who watches.
