The last two keynotes I delivered were to audiences I don't typically present to: PR and marketing professionals.

One of the most important takeaways, based on audience feedback, seems to be this...

Using Generative AI can seem like a really scary thing. I mean, even if you use these technologies, can you even explain how they work? It feels complicated, technical, and for the longest time it was hard to use something like generative AI without also having some knowledge of programming, APIs, etc.

Thinking about the problems you'd like to solve and then attempting to solve them using a general purpose AI tool (think ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) is the simple, but often ignored process.

Lots of folks are waiting for instruction. Waiting to "understand it better." 

My message to those folks is... stop waiting. Jump in. The water is perfectly warm and there's no way to drown. 

If you're not sure where to start, say that in your very first prompt! Converse, iterate, and see what comes up. 

You might just surprise yourself.

My mission right now is to get as many people in the water as possible. If we can outsource the tasks we're less interested in to technology, it gives us more freedom and time to do the stuff we *love* doing without tech intervention.
