I bought the game Rollercoaster Tycoon as a kid because I wanted some kind of immersive video gaming experience riding roller coasters. Turns out the game was actually a simulation of what it would be like to run a theme park. 

I was disappointed to say the least, but back then I didn&#8217;t have another new game available, so I played tycoon. 

Years later, working for big companies and running my own businesses, I&#8217;ve realized that I actually learned a lot from this game. Two lessons that I remember about negotiating and the customer experience. 

  1. The way you “negotiate” in Rollercoaster tycoon is by extending your character’s hand to meet the hand of a potential investor. There&#8217;s no actual business strategy; it&#8217;s more like a hand eye coordination game. Keep clicking until your hand reaches the investor. Sure, negotiating is more than this in reality, but the visual of a hand pulling away and reaching out every few seconds is how a lot of negotiations go. 
  2. Whenever a new ride opens, a floor of people get on the ride. You can tell by their faces if the ride was enjoyable, if it fills a gap in the marketplace. At first, everyone is happy and smiling. At some point the lines get too long and people start getting mad and walking away. I used to get so anxious when it happened at first until I realized it was just what happens every time and it was possible to win even with unhappy customers. If they didn&#8217;t want to wait, that was understandable. Plenty of rides elsewhere in the park. 

I think about both of these all the time. Trying to agree on a path forward is just a version of the hand stretch game, just with emotion and logic. And customers will never be 100% happy, and that&#8217;s okay. We can make products for people who need them and let the others see themselves out.
