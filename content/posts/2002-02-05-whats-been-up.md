The new semester is bittersweet. I have some fuckin' easy classes, and some fuckin' hard ones as well. My caclulus teacher stayed the same, just my luck, and she's a nice woman, and a good teacher&#8230; but I just, don't like calculus. Why can't anyone understand that I'll never need it? When I try to tell anyone that they give me this look like "calculus! of course you'll need it! you can't fly a kite without knowing pythagorean's theorem!"

And of course me missing the class recently has been very not beneficial. Not like I've been skipping &#8212; you can't do anymore anyway, they've come up with an ingenius system that keeps track of what classes you are in. damn bastards and their technological advancements &#8212; I've just been in assemblies. Well I'm makin it sound like I missed more than one day. I only missed today, but I know she taught something crucial, or announced a quiz on Friday or something. Which reminds me, I have a chem test on friday. How fuckin' insane is that eh? It's like the 5th day of the semester and we already have a chem test on Friday.

Let me just say &#8211; Ms Tierney is amazing. So involved with her job, and really gets into it. I am seriously liking english a whole lot this semester. The thing is that I've heard she's a hard grader. But that's ok, since I'm enjoying the class I guess that means I will write good papers? Same with chem&#8230; I'm not ENJOYING the class really, just being able to bear it, and I'm taking notes now, so that is gonna help a lot. Canham is a lot more involved than Charuhas, and even though she is a stickler on pretty much everything, I still think I like her class better. Simply cuz I'm learning more and doing better. Oh, and I finally have a class with Billy again, I haven't had a class with him since spanish freshman year. Oh well, an academic class, we've had chambers together and stuff.

Well the John Mayer show is sold out, and in less than two weeks. On a scale of 1-10 I am excited to a 12. It's going to be so good, my fourth time seeing John, and 3rd time seeing Laura, who'll be at the show &#8230; hanging out with her is heaven, and so is john mayer, so I think this might be one of those paradoxical have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too sorta deals. And like, then take a hot bath for 4 hours. With salts. Like on friends, what a fuckin funny episode.

And of course in April the legendary Dave Matthews Band is playing at the MCI center and I'm going with one of the biggest DMB fans around, Jon Gracia. This kid knows everything there is to know about Dave, all the song's meanings, everything. And a really fuckin' good friend as well. He's also seeing John mayer with me. Now I'm not as hardcore into dave as I used to be, but the guy still is my start, my childhood. Oh, and Michael Jackson.

And of cousre in May, Virginia Coaltion comes to Whitman High School. The show they put on at the 9:30 was more than spectacular, it was honestly, the best show I have ever seen, period. Better than a John Mayer show even, which is pretty fuckin' hard to beat. Just, the energy was so raw, so kickin, so great. I seriously could not understand how a band could be so amazing live.

First rehearsal was today, and Brodsky is down to business. PJ and I were two minutes late to rehearsal, and he told us firmly and politely that "when I say 2:30 it means 2:30, and not 2:32&#8230;" What a large guy. Mitt never asked us questions about our character. As if character development was really a big part of being a good actor anyway ðŸ™‚ We did a readthrough. I've got quite a few lines in the first 2 scenes, and then I'm really not in it anymore. It really sucks that I try so hard and never really get anything out of it. But, I'm gonna do the show with a smile on my face. And not a fake smile either. Committment is about doing something willingly, and if I'm not willing to do it, I shouldn't be there. So I sat there in the chorus room, learning music, and learning it well, putting in effort. I hope Ingram caught that, so she knows that I'm into this. Even if she doesn't, I know I'm into this.

We had an arts assembly today and Jon played my recordings again. It's getting less and less awkward hearing my shit.

Cotton twill cap #35003 color hazel nut, retail 15 dollars. Jon says the way to get through life is to remember "one eyed one horned flying purple people eater." You decide if he's wise or an idiot.

When she says she wants someone to love, I hope you know, she doesn't mean you.
