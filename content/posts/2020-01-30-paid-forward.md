I was in a Barnes and Noble once browsing the history shelves. I was teaching a fourth grade unit on the revolution, something I hadn’t really absorbed much as a child, and I wanted to become somewhat of an expert. Hamilton (the musical) had just come out, which helped aid some of my work with the students. I remember telling them that it would be one of the most important musicals of all time.

One of the books I pulled out was Meecham’s book on Thomas Jefferson. As I was looking at the book, a lady stopped by and said “that’s one of my favorites.” 

“Really? I’m trying to teach my students about the revolution. Was just looking through some of these books…&#8221;

“Get that one,” she said. “Trust me. I’m a history buff. It’s fantastic.&#8221;

After a little more looking, I ended up figuring that I’d go online to find more reviews and resources about what I should read. As I came down the escalator, the woman that had approached me was standing there with a bag.

“Here,” she said. Inside the bag was the Jefferson book.

“Wow. Thanks. Can I get your name, at least?&#8221;

“Nope,” she said.

And then we were both off. I still haven’t read the book. But the experience of connecting with someone and receiving an anonymous gift was invigorating. I await the next time that I can receive or give a gift in this way.
