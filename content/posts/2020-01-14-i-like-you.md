If I say that I like you, please know that I am saying we are _alike._

No, we’re not identical, and perhaps there’s only a tiny cross-section of personality that we share. But if I like you (and it’s mutual), we’ve found a little grassy area for a picnic. We’ve found our topic of conversation, a conversation that we will have to abandon when it’s time to leave, and pick back up again when we reunite.
