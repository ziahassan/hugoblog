"Leave emotion at the door" is a common phrase when it comes to entering the work place.

There's also the famous "work life" balance, as if life is not part work, and work is not part of life.

As you seek direction, betterment, peace, tranquality, whatever it is you're here for...

Keep in mind this important fact: it's _all_ life. 

And, it's _all_ work. 

Sometimes it happens in an office.

Sometimes it happens in your backyard on a Saturday.

The deadlines you meet, the dinners you eat, the soccer games you attend, the books you devour...

They all live in the same goopy life space.

What a relief.
