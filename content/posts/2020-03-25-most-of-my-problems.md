Most of my problems are not solvable.

Most of my problems do not come with a money back guarantee.

Most of my problems are not cheap. They are investment products. They contain a portfolio, with values and returns fluctuating on a daily basis.

Most of my problems are not created by society.

Most of my problems are generated from within.
