For a long time, I didn’t care much about getting a haircut, or cutting my nails before they got really long, or shaving every day. I actually got pretty upset if someone told me I needed a haircut… like, actually, I don’t _need_ your _shit_. 

And then, at some point in my mid-20’s, I became hyper-aware of my body. If my beard got just a little too long, it would become unbearable and scratchy and if I was out at dinner I’d rush home to shave it. It came on out of nowhere, seemingly. 

I started to agree with all those comments about “you really need a haircut.” 

And so now, when I sit down in the barber’s chair, I take note of how I’m feeling before and after the deed is done. Before, there is hair on my neck, my sideburns are sticking out making my face wider, and after…

I feel free. It’s almost like all the hair that accumulated on my skin in the past however long also allowed feelings to accumulate. Little tiny paper cuts, losses, wins, joys, fears… over the course of 20 minutes, all on the tile floor to be swept away.

Is it that really that easy to start over?
