Going through my LinkedIn feed, you would think the whole world is talking about (and is smarter about) the topics I regularly write and talk about when it comes to AI in education.

But I can still blow minds when I give keynotes or workshops outside of LinkedIn.

I describe [Byron King](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/byronkingjhb_genai-aied-aieducation-activity-7205105952813989889-nUSZ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)'s "bubble" more as a phase 1, where not everyone is up to speed on using GenAI, but the momentum is growing and at some point things till tip. In Phase 2, we will all be able to use GEnAI to get work done in the same way we can all use email for communications (or, the alternative might be something like Excel, which everyone kind of knows how to use but few people really know how to optimize).

To me, the way we move forward is by getting people to think computationally and understanding the role of delegation (which i have found, humans are notoriously bad at doing, especially if they have competence).

This means being curious about how this tech can enhance our lives, and then trying things out. You can't break anything.
