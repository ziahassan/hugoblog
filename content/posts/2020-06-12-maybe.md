When you&#8217;re in a yoga class, they give you instructions on the basic pose. And then, they say _maybe_. _Maybe_ you could walk your hands out more. _Maybe_ you could challenge yourself by shifting your posture so that you&#8217;re using more of your core. _Maybe_ do the hard thing.

I love this practice. _Maybe_ is a word that contains so many possibilities, an endless amount of paths, an infinite forest.

Everyone&#8217;s _maybe_ refers to a completely unique set of paths.

Within _maybe_, you can see all the fantasies that will one day be realized.
