I’ve recently gotten back into newsletters. Not ones from companies, but ones from actual people (currently, I’m enjoying Austin Kleon’s, which includes 10 interesting things to check out).

What I love about these newsletters is that I’ve already given permission to the creators. I’ve already enrolled in a list, and I actually look forward to the newsletter every week. Compare this to my RSS or Facebook or Twitter feed, which basically does exactly what the word “feed” entails: it feeds me… total crap. Since we literally scroll through our feeds searching for gems amongst a sea of shit, the headlines and 160 character tweets have to be eyeball-grabbing. So we have our eyeballs grabbed and released over and over until something of value appears or until we get tired and move on.

The newsletters I subscribe to are illustrious, well-designed, and full of interesting content. It might make sense to scale down my intake to _just_ newsletters, only returning to the land of social media every week or so.

If only.
