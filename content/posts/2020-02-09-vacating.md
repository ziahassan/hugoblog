As we plan our summer, I&#8217;m reminded of a very important fact: vacating (the verb associated with vacation) has always led to a good piece of art.

One of my favorite songs I&#8217;ve ever written was the result of a trip to Singapore and Malaysia. I&#8217;ve finished huge projects before while traveling due to downtime and being outside of my routine.

I always complain during long trips that they&#8217;re _too_ long. But it&#8217;s the space that makes them work, the distance that opens my brain.

The brain of an artist is a moving target; exposing ourselves intentionally to inputs is how we get our most groundbreaking output.
