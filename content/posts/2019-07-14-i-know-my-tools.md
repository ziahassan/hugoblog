I describe myself as a technologist sometimes when I&#8217;m explaining what I do for a living. The other day, someone asked what this means and I was reminded of something that my old boss said to me once. 

I was trying to solve some problem with our software and kept coming up empty. As a last resort, I asked her for help and she went back to her desk for a few minutes. When she returned, she&#8217;d solved the problem. 

“How did you do that?” I asked. 

She smiled and said, “I know my tools.”

I think about this all the time. To me, being a technologist is being a master of tools. It&#8217;s knowing which one to use at which time. 

It&#8217;s the way I felt about my endodontist during a recent root canal&#8230; he knew what every single instrument did, and was quicker with the tools than most endodontists I had encountered. I felt safe in his office and it because he was a good technologists. 

Or another time when a locksmith next door helped my friend with the lock on his back door. He was quick and efficient. I complimented his work, and he shrugged described it as “ape’s work&#8230;” but I believe he just knew his tools. 

Whenever you feel inadequate, or inefficient, it&#8217;s possible that you just have some more to learn about your tools.
