\*Yawn\*

Had fun last night. Got with Christine around 5 and she had a stomach ache so we coudln't really do much sexually. But it was so much fun just being with her, getting the wrong happy meal&#8230; going back and getting ice cream. I had my mom take her home and I fell asleep around 11. That's really early considering I don't have school the next day. This whole break thing is amazingly fun.

Parking permit. Gotta remember that.

By the way, note to future self. Don't ever feel bad about how much Christine likes you or how much time she spends with you. It's enough, more than enough, and she really does love you.
