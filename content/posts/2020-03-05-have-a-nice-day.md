It’d be nice if we could have one, the way we have a glass of water. 

Nice days are made by the blood, sweat, and tears of the not so nice days. They’re constructed, carefully, to appear in a flash sometimes when everything has gone to shit, and everyone is desperate. That’s when we have nice days.

But we can also create nice days in a flash. Instead of saying _have_ a nice day, we could choose to say _what_ a nice day. 

Then, the day is transformed.
