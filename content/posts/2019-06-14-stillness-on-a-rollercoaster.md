Try this: bring back a memory of yourself on a roller coaster or theme park ride. Whenever I do this, my memory doesn&#8217;t play back like memories of other events. That is to say, when I think of my high school graduation, it plays back like clips from a movie. Sometimes in these memories, I am not the point of view, I&#8217;m the observer. Maybe I&#8217;m actually having s memory of watching the _video_ of graduation. 

But when I think of a roller coaster memory, it&#8217;s different. There&#8217;s no real motion in my mind movie. It&#8217;s a still frame. I&#8217;m upside down on a steel coaster, the sun invading my corneas from a cloudless sky. And it&#8217;s quiet inside of this moment.

Or I&#8217;m next to my cousin who&#8217;s mad at me for whatever reason. I see her angry face right as we hit the bottom of a drop. There is a stillness in the midst of this dance between potential and kinetic energy. 

How can it be that such a chaotic memory is recalled as a moment of stillness? Perhaps when we ride a roller coaster, we lose ourselves. It&#8217;s nearly impossible to be in our own head, and we are definitely not thinking about what&#8217;s for dinner. We are observing our sensations, like the Buddha. We have no other choice. Our lives are gently at risk, and yet we feel safe. There&#8217;s no comparable experience. 

And now in my 30s, roller coasters give me headaches. But I will forever be in search of experiences that gently meld together feelings of safety, exhilaration, and stillness.
