Do you like advice?

If so, you're not alone. Many people on the LinkedIn platform are here for career advancement. 

There are not only many people giving advice, but there are also many people who lack a sense of direction and are looking for advice.

Therefore, it's common to see a lot of advice here about what you should be doing and what you shouldn't.

"Don't get a job as a (fill in the blank)!"
"Don't pursue (some degree)!"
"You should always ..."
"Never do this..." 

Especially if you are directionless or searching for new career options, it's very easy to get caught up in all the advice. Especially if you read people's comments that usually say "thank you, great advice" which is the stock response on LinkedIn posts.

And as a corollary, it is easy to forget that YOU have your own internal navigation system, just like the people giving advice.

As a coach who helps people navigate their career journeys, I have many clients who complain about all the conflicting advice they see on LinkedIn.

Most of it is phrased strongly to draw attention to profiles of creators. If you've ever attended any sort of marketing course or workshop, you've been told that you need to have super strong opinions or else no one will read your content.

I understand the logic behind this. 

But if you are a person who is trying to navigate your career journey, listening to what everyone tells you on LinkedIn may be counterintuitive.

So, instead of advice, I'm going to end this post with some questions for self-reflecton:

1. Forget all the "shoulds" and "don'ts" - what do YOU really want?
2. What's one actionable step, even if it's imperfect, you could take today to move toward the life you want?
3. What's in your way?
