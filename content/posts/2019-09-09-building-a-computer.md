When I was 11, I visited my uncle in England. We were moving into his house and he told me he was ordering a new computer. I got really excited to play games on it.

When it arrived, it came in various boxes. It turned out my uncle, to save money, had ordered computer _parts_. With very little time to deal with the computer, he tasked me with building.

“…build a computer?” I asked.

“Just put the parts together. Can’t be that hard.”

I waded through the boxes and pulled out foreign looking objects like memory cards and internal hard drives and fans and what not.

I don’t quite remember what happened after that. Some force took over, one that I hadn’t experienced before but became addicted to thereafter. It was the feeling of feeling a “flow” mixed in with intense curiosity, persistence, and a glimmer of the beauty of success, somewhere off in the distance.

I put all the parts together to make a computer and it felt glorious. Not only was the success sweet, but I had learned how to put something complex together. It showed me that it was possible, that there was value in the process. I believe this event woke the DIY demon living dormant in my soul. I have since been addicted to taking complex, seemingly impossible problems&#8230; things like writing an app, learning jazz guitar&#8230; and breaking them down into modules, and tackling each module with all my might.

May we continue to have experiences like this one &#8211; ones where the task at hand is so compelling that it drives us _just_ crazy enough to be victorious.
