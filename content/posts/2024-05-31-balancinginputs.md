From [[Zettelkasten/Cards/Thinkers/Austin Kleon|Austin Kleon]]:

> During a recent phone call, my friend [Matt Thomas](https://substack.com/redirect/51bc9be9-320d-453f-9612-5219b00149d9?j=eyJ1IjoiMnQxMmgifQ.fk0jTED9euRgHoRaY5C9-naZ29lv6nS_XQMiZp34Xo4) told me he likes to take a high/low approach to balancing [his input](https://substack.com/redirect/1acca1a5-379d-4820-846e-3adbd30147ec?j=eyJ1IjoiMnQxMmgifQ.fk0jTED9euRgHoRaY5C9-naZ29lv6nS_XQMiZp34Xo4), which started when he was in grad school reading dense theoretical texts by day and chasing them with movies like _[Fast Five](https://substack.com/redirect/32e61b95-a06e-4bea-9673-c9b3e32cd21d?j=eyJ1IjoiMnQxMmgifQ.fk0jTED9euRgHoRaY5C9-naZ29lv6nS_XQMiZp34Xo4)_ at night. I’ve currently got a good combo going: I’m reading _[Middlemarch](https://substack.com/redirect/f332162e-eb97-4a40-8b12-0ac469fd70a9?j=eyJ1IjoiMnQxMmgifQ.fk0jTED9euRgHoRaY5C9-naZ29lv6nS_XQMiZp34Xo4)_ and binge-watching _[Bridgerton](https://substack.com/redirect/4b5870d2-7d82-451f-aadf-1acc951df961?j=eyJ1IjoiMnQxMmgifQ.fk0jTED9euRgHoRaY5C9-naZ29lv6nS_XQMiZp34Xo4)_. (As the poet Donald Hall wrote in _[Essays After Eighty](https://substack.com/redirect/913355b1-6da9-49dd-a899-bbc16b185516?j=eyJ1IjoiMnQxMmgifQ.fk0jTED9euRgHoRaY5C9-naZ29lv6nS_XQMiZp34Xo4)_, everybody who works with their brains all day [needs to lighten up a bit at night](https://substack.com/redirect/23764a69-252b-4ea3-96e7-2fb221eb71e5?j=eyJ1IjoiMnQxMmgifQ.fk0jTED9euRgHoRaY5C9-naZ29lv6nS_XQMiZp34Xo4): “Before Yeats went to sleep every night he read an American Western. When Eliot was done with poetry and editing, he read a mystery book.”

This is also related to the [[Second screen]] effect. The need to have "something on in the background" while working on something else.

What if we just did the chill out activity? 

What if I committed to watching an entire season of Love Island? 

etc.
