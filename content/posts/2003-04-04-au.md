I _cannot_ wait for college. I went to American tonight to see Matt Nathanson play. They have this thing stage set up in their cafeteria with a nice sound system and everything. Problem is the sound crew is _horrible_. I'm nervous because I'm going to school there for sound next year. I really hope they weren't students in that program.

The show was really good, and Matt got so frustrated with the sound he ended up just unplugging his guitar and standing on an amp and playing kumbaya style. It was fun. I went with Jon, Tony, and Billy.

Tommorow is Friday and I might skip school or something. Being a second semester (4th quarter) senior, and I can't stress this enough, RULES. In a good mood tonight, gonna go to sleep happy. Maybe I'll read a chapter outta Les Mis before I hit the sack.
