We hosted a dinner a while back and made the entire meal ourselves. We had a romantic experience in the kitchen, tossing ingredients, dancing to music, tasting, and smelling. When we saw the reaction to the food we’d made, it was a nice cap to the end of a great experience from start to finish.

The joy of a potluck is that every person contributing gets to have this experience. Every person gets the experience and journey of cooking a dish for others, and watching their reactions. And every person gets to consume another person’s creation, in what becomes a very intimate exchange.
