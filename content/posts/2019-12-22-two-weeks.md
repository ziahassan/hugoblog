Two weeks is a unit of my life.

It’s the distance between therapy sessions, between check-ins, between meetings. 

It used to be a week, back in the good old days. But now I need a full two to really understand what I’m dealing with and where I’m at.

The weekend in the middle, the half way point, is a tiny little compass pointing us to the light at the end.
