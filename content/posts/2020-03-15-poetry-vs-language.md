You can’t really separate the two because all language _is_ poetry.

Consider that in Spanish, “I missed the bus” becomes “the bus missed me.&#8221;

Or the fact that some authors, when their books are translated, fine the translations to be more beautiful and paradoxical than they could have ever imagined in their native language.

Or the fact that when we talk in conversation, we’re constantly making metaphors, connecting the dots of our brain.

Or the fact that some poetry just looks like a person’s thoughts with line breaks, while other kinds of poetry have a rhythm. All of it counts.

Consider news articles that use language to make us inspired or scared.

Consider the format of this blog post, which now looks more like a poem than a blog post.

We can’t just give facts without coloring those facts with our own poetry. Whether we intend to or not.
