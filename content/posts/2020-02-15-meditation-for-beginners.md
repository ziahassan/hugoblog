This is a misnomer. Once of the classic texts in Zen literature is Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind by Suzuki. Among other points, he rightly claims that every time we meditate, regardless of how many years experience we have doing it, we’re always starting at the same place. We’re always a beginner. No one has mastered Zazen. Not even those who consider themselves enlightened. Perhaps _especially_ those who consider themselves enlightened. 

I once read a John Mayer interview years ago where he said that every time he writes a song, he feels like it’s the first time he’s ever written anything. The same fears, the same doubts, the same creative struggle, even with many hit records and awards.

Do we ever leave the beginner stage? Perhaps in some ways. But when we’re creating a piece of art from scratch, or a quiet moment, or sitting zazen… it’s _always_ the first time.
