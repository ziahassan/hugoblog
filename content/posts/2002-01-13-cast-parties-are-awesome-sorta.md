hit parade was damn fun last night. the cast party was soooo great, all the theater guys know how to have a good time.  
somehow i just feel outta place. i'm considering not trying out for brigadoon for a few reasons. 1, for the past two shows i've been feeling so weird, so outta place and lonely. and 2, junior year is kickin my ass and I have to somehow keep my grades up. it's gonna be hard with a musical going on&#8230; i had a hard time just managing hit parade. fuck it, i'm gonna audition, i know i am. there's no way i'd miss out. it's my last show with a buncha my good friends. and probably my first with a buncha new ones.

that's pretty much what everyone says though. that they're not gonna audition, and then they do.

chris made an interesting comment the other day about my music. he said it's pretty much all underdog music. he's right I guess. do I consider myself an underdog? sure. I can't really justify that though. you just have to know me to understand. or listen to my music or something.

my parents thought the show went well, they liked the stuff that I was in. My sister found it cool that they were playing my music beforehand. Thanks jon.

I can't say I really loved my performance. There's always something missing, but I guess you could ask anyone and they'd say the same thing about their performance. There's always next time though, and hopefully by then i'll have improved a little.

I have to say this journal thing is so weird. I mean, people are gonna read this. What if they see something that makes them think that I wrote it for them or something? What if I did? What if I didn't? This thing could cause some problems&#8230; none yet but we'll see as it progresses. I kinda like the idea though it gives me something to do.

So exams are coming up. This means mad studying on my part . I'm going C-E in calculus so I have to pull off an A or a B on the exam. It's much harder than it sounds. MUCH. Maybe some miracle will happen and i'll get a B and then I'll get a C in calculus. That would be IDEAL. I also need a freakin good grade in my other classes or I'm gonna get such a shitty GPA. It's kinda stopped mattering to me though, I don't really care anymore. I've given up or something.

not only on school just on people in general. I keep doing things and then not understanding why I did them. that, and I can't find out my way out of a paper bag. it's scary as shit.

"i'm not alone. i wish i was. cuz then i'd know i'm down because i coudln't find a friend around to love me like they do right now. and all is well, I can't complain, well ok, I guess I could. I got my place, I got my name, I chase my tail all the same. I can't figure out what's keeping me down. Something's missing and I don't know how to fix it. I don't know what it is&#8230; at all."

english project due tuesday, ap world paper due thursday. i fuckin' can't stand it. exam week will be cool. i plan to get ready for it in advance so that way when it comes i can just chill on the days off. I also really hope it snows soon, it doesn't really look like winter outside.

Wow, the sky looks really blue today. lotsa oxygen. I just laughed at myself for writing that.it's true though, it is a GORGEOUS day outside. What am I doing today? I'm supposed to be doing that english project. I also have to get ready for the audition tommorow. A little nervous. Go'ah speak in a sco' ish accent. Rrrrrol my rrr's an' whatno'.

I'll probably go out with matt and pj, cus I think we were planning to. And then some more recording with utkarsh. It's a shame that he's leaving in a week and I really haven't actually hung out with him outside of laying down acoustic tracks in my bedroom.

Sundays SUCK. everybody is screaming, water is running, someone is always being bitchy. and my mom's idea of my room being clean differs from mine.

HOW COME A ROOM HAS TO BE CLEAN? it seriously doens't have to always be clean godammit. can't people just live with the fact that when you use things in your room, which is the normal procedure, you have to take them out, and sometimes, JUST SOMETIMES, you don't put them back . IT'S NOT A FUCKIN BIG DEAL, no one is going to die from it.

I got nervous about something this morning, having to do with this live journal. What if I write a really personal post one day and forget to set the security level to private or something. That would be really bad cuz I haven't figured out if you can delete posts yet.

Alright it's almost 1. Time to work. I really fuckin hope I don't get distracted. I just wanna sleep for a really really really long time. John Mayer once said that love is a hot shower where your skin never prunes. I'm sayin that love (and other forms of happiness) are a sleep where you never feel the need to wake up.

sometimes, i wish that i was a vegetable.
