Lists should be a part of every person&#8217;s toolset, when trying to solve a problem.

It&#8217;s not just to-do or task lists. Any set of items that are woven together by a common thread counts.

Occasionally, it helps to forget about the to-do list and create a &#8220;to-done&#8221; list. Instead of writing down what youÂ _need_ to do, you write done what you&#8217;ve already done that was successful.

I use this with my newborn (who is almost out of newborn status). Any time I do some weird action that causes him to sleep better, or be less fussy, I write it down. When I am totally depleted, I turn to this list. If the same action doesn&#8217;t work twice because he&#8217;s changed, or because it was a fluke&#8230; I cross it off the list.

In some ways, this doesn&#8217;t seem like an actual solution. After all, the techniques on the list either work or they don&#8217;t, and sometimes it&#8217;s hard to tell if something that worked once will ever work again.

But writing is thinking. I can think deeply in my head about how to manage my child and fight a battle each day when it comes time to take action, or I can use a tool like a list to sort through all of the different widgets I could crank to achieve the goal.

And maybe that&#8217;s why a list is full of magic. The list (any list) transforms large, complex ideas into achievable, do-able, crankable widgets (as David Allen puts it). It turns the waterfall into bottled water, and it makes a room of books turn into a library.

And once you&#8217;ve got widgets, anyone can crank those. The list becomes a flyswatter, a ladle, a spatula, a sifter.
