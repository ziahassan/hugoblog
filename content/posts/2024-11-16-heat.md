I know I'm going to take some heat for this, but here goes:

When you start your argument with "I know I'm gonna get some hate for this but...," you're weakening your argument.

I figure people do it because it makes readers click "under the fold." 

So, you start your piece in a defensive way, call attention to the fact that your view is unpopular, but at least people read your argument.

And, those who do agree (shockingly, you end up getting less heat than you proclaimed you would) feel even more validated that their views were expressed.

The things we do to get attention and readership on the internet are really at odds with the principles of good writing. 

At least it feels that way, sometimes.
