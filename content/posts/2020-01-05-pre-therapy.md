In the waiting room of my therapist&#8217;s office, there&#8217;s a huge TV screen that shows a live feed of the view from the International Space Station.

Another thing: because her office is filled with other therapists, everyone has a white noise machine outside of their room to make sure nothing from the session is heard outside.

So most times while I&#8217;m waiting for her, I&#8217;m watching the world from space and drowning in a sea of ambient white noise. There is no better way to start therapy. In fact, the pre-therapy is a kind of therapy in and of itself.
