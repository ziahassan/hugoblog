I’m thankful that I can type a blog post from a device that fits into my pocket. It’s a dream I’ve always had, ever since I was a kid.

I’m thankful that airplanes can transport people to places that are far away, so that they can spend time with the people they don’t see every day.

I’m thankful that my 12 week old is starting to sleep through the night. 

I’m thankful for thankfulness. Thanksgiving always forces me to stop and enjoy small moments. Maybe thankfulness is just the feeling we have when we’re enjoying life. And maybe we can remember how it feels to do that in the summer, too.
