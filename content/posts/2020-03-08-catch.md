A fun way to parent is to play throw & catch with your child. This isn’t limited to balls.

One version of it is when I’m in the car with my son and he throws out “dada!” I catch and respond with “Dezi!” Throw and a catch. He says “Dada!” again and on it goes until one of us gets distracted by something else.

Or if we’re playing with his ukulele, and he’ll play a chord and hand me the instrument. I’ll play a chord and hand it back.

This is my life: throwing and catching in an infinite game.
