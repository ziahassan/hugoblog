I&#8217;m a huge fan of routines in general. I learned as a teacher is that routines are comforting to children _and_ adults. It seems obvious, yet we rarely think about how we can use routines strategically. 

One popular way that designing a routine has become a bit more mainstream is the idea of a morning routine, or the actions we take when we rise each morning. Drink a warm glass of lemon water, do yoga, write in a journal, eat a small meal. Do it every day when you wake up, and your day will continue to have some kind of structure. 

It&#8217;s become a trend lately for people to post these routines as YouTube videos or blog posts. Seems like it&#8217;d be helpful, but it&#8217;s actually nonsense. 

Here&#8217;s why: the benefit here is not knowing the components of someone&#8217;s routine, it&#8217;s just _having a routine in the first place_. Knowing what comprises Richard Branson’s morning routine won&#8217;t help us &#8211; the things he does in the morning reflect his own values and needs. Doing what he does won&#8217;t make us in any way like him, any more than eating 3000 calories a day like Michael Phelps does won&#8217;t turn us into Olympic athletes. 

So make a morning routine, yes, but don&#8217;t model it after anyone else&#8217;s. Especially someone you admire. 

You have everything you need in your brain to determine the right structure for your life. The key is consistency, not influence from others.
