Something interesting to consider is that being a scientist about your medical data is probably a more efficient route than waiting for a diagnosis.

I'm not suggesting skipping the doctor.

But the doctor can't really see what you're doing when you're not in their office.

They can't keep tabs on your habits, your posture, your meals, your fitness, etc.

They don't know about how you reached into your backseat for something, and then forgot about it later when you complained about your shoulder pain.

Better idea: rather than waiting for a diagnosis, we become _proactive_ in our health mysteries.

We keep rigorous data around our ailments.

We ask AI to analyze those and look for patterns (without asking for a diagnosis). 

The trick is to making sure that AI or Google doesn't give you false diagnoses; the idea is simply to look for patterns and then report these back to your primary care after having AI analyze the patterns.

They could use this to help with their work, and they'll probably thank you as long as you didn't add a bunch of extra AI-induced hallucinations somehow.
