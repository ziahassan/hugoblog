If you set the start time for an event at 5, it&#8217;s because you have young children. Or perhaps a very efficient social life. Or perhaps a need for sunlight.

If you set the start time for an event at 6, it&#8217;s because you want to go to bed early.

If you set the start time for an event at 7, it&#8217;s because you want to be social.

If you set the start time for an event at 8, it&#8217;s because you want to be intoxicated (by any drug, including hormones).

If you set the start time for an event at 9, it&#8217;s because you want to be _seen_ as intoxicated.

If you set the start time for an event at 10, it&#8217;s because you desire to be intoxicating.

And if it&#8217;s an &#8220;open house,&#8221; you give guests the opportunity to explore their motives.
