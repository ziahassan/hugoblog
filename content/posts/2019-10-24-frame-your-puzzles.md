Driving down the road, I saw a sign next to a framing store that said “frame your puzzles.”

They must have meant jigsaw, but when I hear the word _puzzle_, I think about the mysteries that surround me in life. 

How to frame these puzzles? The ones that keep us up at night, that confuse and befuddle us, that amaze us and terrify us?

Perhaps it&#8217;s the same way we&#8217;d frame the jig saw &#8211; we assemble the pieces in a way that gives them meaning, and then we show everyone the result. 

But once that’s done, and once our wall is full of framed puzzles….what next?
