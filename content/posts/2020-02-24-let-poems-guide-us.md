Itâ€™s different than reading a magazine article, or even a book. 

A poem affords a certain kind of freedom to its creator, the type of rule-less-ness that produces creativity, that connects disjointed ideas, that makes a person see themselves in the past, present, and future all at the same time. 

We can let poems guide us, both in reading them and writing them.
