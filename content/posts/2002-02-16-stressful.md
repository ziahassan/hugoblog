I'm always in two different kinds of moods. The headphone mood, or the stereo mode. Meaning that sometimes I'm in the type of mood where I'll want to just sit and listen to my headphones. It's like having a warm shower. Which I never get anymore mind you, my sister wakes up before me and takes the absolute hottest shower. living NO HOT WATER FOR ME.

Toinght was so freaking trippy. Like, SO trippy. Here's what happened. My friends called it couples night, and everyone was with their girlfriend or boyfriend. So andy and I, pretty much the only single guys around, decided we'd go over to linzy's house and hang with her and christine. Easy task. First we went to Wendy's and when we came out of the restuaurant, Andy noticed a dent in the back corner of my car, as if someone had tried to park next to it, and hit it. And I did a good parking job, seriously. It was so messed up. Then, when I got home we were eating our food, and this white van pulls up next to my house. There are two guys in the van, who look youngish. 20's maybe. Anyway they turn off the lights inside the car, and turn on the headlights. And just wait, for like 10 mins. I was fucking scared outta my mind, I had no idea what to do. So of course, being the dumbass I am, I went out there. They drove away really quickly. I dunno what the fuck they were trying to do but I was scared shitless. THEN, on the way lindsay's house, this jeep was behind me, beeping at me and stuff, for no apparent reason, and then tried to overtake me on dufief mill, by crossing over the double yellow line. It was the scariest thing EVER.

Then andy went home&#8230; and I told my parents everything except about the dent. When they find it, I'm just going to say that I have no idea where it came from. Which is true. but the lie is in the fact that I didn't notice it before. So it's going to be a risky manuever but I'm going to try and do it.

So it was a fucked up evening. Fun but fucked up. And I have a dent in my car.

and any romantic endeavors that I thought I had, I'm giving up right now&#8230; just no point.
