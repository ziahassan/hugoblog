The towel hanger on the back of the bathroom door fell off this morning. 

It’s the third piece of the bathroom to break in the last week or so. First the knob on the shower handle, then then stopper lever on the faucet, and now this.

_This house is falling apart,_ I thought to myself.

And then, another thought: _This house is always falling apart. And it’s always being repaired. And through it all, it stays calm… so why can’t I?_

Perhaps a house is like a mountain. Constantly in flux, but present throughout. It’s nature that changes a mountain, the siding on the house… but it’s _humans_ who break and repair the inside of the house. 

But then the voice reminds me that _humans are part of nature too_. 

And I feel infinitely better about the towel hanger all of a sudden.
