After reading Cal Newport’s Digital Minimalism, I&#8217;ve decided to give a social media detox a try. So as of today for the rest of March, I&#8217;ll be off Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram (other than my work accounts). 

I&#8217;m keeping Reddit, RSS, and YouTube because they don&#8217;t have that addictive quality for me. At least for now. YouTube is a major timesuck but I basically use it as my TV provider so I consider it necessary. But I&#8217;ll be blocking it during most of the day using the Freedom app. I may even experiment with giving up Spotify but the alternatives are more expensive or slightly limited. 

The idea is that without access to these accounts for a full 30 days, I&#8217;ll be able to return to them in a meaningful way in April. And the other nice thing about that is it will be _April_ and the weather will be much nicer. 

I will still continue writing and will post a new piece every day automatically to Twitter, I just won&#8217;t be able to see it happen, or respond to any replies (which never really happens anyway). 

I&#8217;ve experimented a bit in February with limiting access to social. Using the Freedom app to block Facebook was successful but I still found myself mindlessly surfing during non-work times. As much I wanted to avoid a full on detox, it appears that&#8217;s what’s necessary.

I believe that social media is as bad for us as sugar or nicotine, but that there is one thing that can change the addiction: intention. Every time we log in without an intention of what we want to do (look at our family&#8217;s baby pics, collect news stories, etc.) we are essentially gambling. We are pulling the slot machine to see what comes up. 

And it&#8217;s rarely cherries. You know it. I know it. 

Social is a bit like the house in a gambling scenario. 

And the house always wins.
