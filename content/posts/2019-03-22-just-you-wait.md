“Just you wait until you get married. Your life choices get narrower.”

“Just you wait until you have a child. Your life is no longer about you.”

“Just you wait until you have two kids. It&#8217;s completely different than having one.”

Seems like most of our time as a parent is spent either doing the “just wait” or the “right now.”

I do the right now when I&#8217;m giving my kid a bath; a lot of coordination is required to make sure he doesn&#8217;t hurt himself or drown. 

I do the just wait when I see toddlers having meltdowns in public.

But I think the key to staying afloat as a parent is making a 3:1 ratio for right now to just wait. Anticipation can be useful for planning and forward thinking, but only in infrequent small doses.
